Additionally, some studies propose that life could exist in a dormant state, while others argue that the clouds are too dry and hostile for any known form of life to survive.\n\nThe conflicting evidence indicates that while there is a possibility of life in Venus' clouds, the current data does not provide a definitive answer.
