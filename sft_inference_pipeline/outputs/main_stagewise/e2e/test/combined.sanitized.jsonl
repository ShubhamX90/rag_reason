The antibacterial properties of honey come from its natural antiseptic properties, such as hydrogen peroxide and its low pH level [d2, d3, d4, d5, d6]. Therefore, while honey may contain beneficial bacteria for some applications, it is important to note that it can also harbor harmful bacteria, especially for infants [d1, d10, d15].\n[[END-OF-ANSWER]]"}
