Documents d1, d4, d5, and d9 provide strong support for the positive effects of tax cuts on economic growth, job creation, and household income. For instance, d1 mentions that corporate income tax cuts generate “large and persistent” positive effects on the economy in the long run. Similarly, d4 notes that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has led to increased investment and higher household income. Furthermore, d9 highlights that 3.2 million new jobs have been created since the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the long-term benefits may be concentrated in a shorter time horizon, as suggested by d1, which indicates that the benefits of personal income tax cuts are often concentrated in the short run, while corporate income tax cuts have stronger long-run impacts.\n\nIn conclusion, tax cuts can be beneficial for the economy, especially in the long run, but their effects may vary depending on the type of tax cut and the time frame considered.\n\n[[END-OF-ANSWER]]", "has_sentinel": true}
