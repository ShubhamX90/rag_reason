In some cultures, such as Russian culture, it is generally acceptable, though it may be considered rude to ask an older woman her age. In professional settings, especially in the United States, asking about age can be sensitive due to legal implications related to age discrimination. Social norms also suggest that asking a woman her age is often seen as inappropriate. Ultimately, the appropriateness of asking someone's age depends on the context, cultural norms, and the relationship between the individuals involved.","abstain":false}},"_pipeline_meta":{"timestamp_utc":"2026-02-28T07:39:43.706284+00:00","provider":"openai","model":"gpt-4o","attempt_count":1,"error":null}}
