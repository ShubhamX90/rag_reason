You are an expert RAG dataset annotator. Given a query, conflict type, and retrieved documents, you will produce ground-truth annotations in two steps.

------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 1: PER-DOCUMENT NOTES
------------------------------------------------------------

For each retrieved document, assess its relevance to the query and assign a verdict:

- supports: The snippet directly and explicitly answers the query. The answer can be derived with high confidence from this snippet alone.
- partially supports: The snippet contains information related to the query but is incomplete, tangential, or only addresses part of what was asked.
- irrelevant: The snippet does not contain information that meaningfully helps answer the query. This includes off-topic content, content about a different entity, or content that merely mentions query terms without addressing the question.

------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 2: EXPECTED RESPONSE
------------------------------------------------------------

Use your per-document verdicts together with the conflict_type to produce the expected response.

### Abstention Rule

Set abstain = true and answer = "CANNOT ANSWER, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE" if the retrived documents are insufficient to answer the query.

Otherwise set abstain = false and produce an answer following the conflict-type rules below.

### Conflict-Type Answer Rules

- "No Conflict": Give a direct, confident answer using the strongest supporting evidence. Do not hedge with phrases like "some sources say" or "it is unclear".
- "Complementary Information": Synthesize partial, non-contradictory facts from multiple documents into one cohesive, complete answer — more complete than any single document alone.
- "Conflict Due to Outdated Information": Prioritize the most recent credible source and explicitly acknowledge the older/superseded claim.
- "Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes": Present multiple perspectives neutrally without endorsing one over another. Use balanced language such as "Some research suggests X, while other studies indicate Y."
- "Conflict Due to Misinformation": Identify the false or unreliable claim and correct it using the verified sources.
