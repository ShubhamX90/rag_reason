          "snippet": "Baby teething fever: What is it? How is it treated? What is baby teething fever? Teething is the process where an infant’s teeth erupt through the gums. This can lead to various symptoms, such as mild fussiness and discomfort. Many parents and caregivers report that fever is also a sign of teething. However, there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. Fever may coincide with teething, but it likely indicates a separate health issue, such as an infection. This article explores some reasons why teething and fever may occur together. We also outline the symptoms associated with teething, as well as those that are not. Finally, we provide tips on how to soothe teething discomfort, how to treat a fever, and when to see a doctor. Increased exposure to new pathogens: At 6–12 months of age, the infant is sucking and chewing various objects as they explore their world by putting things in their mouth. This exposes them to new pathogens. Loss of antibodies: When infants are 6–12 months old, they begin to lose antibodies that their mother transfers to them during birth. This means their immune system has to respond to more infections, such as colds. To summarize, fever may occur around the same time as teething. However, fever is a sign of infection, rather than a normal symptom of teething. Most babies begin teething at around 6 months of age. However, some babies can start as early as 4 months, while some commence teething as late as 12 months. After the first set of teeth come through, infants will continue to get new teeth every couple of months. Below are some symptoms babies may experience while teething. Pain Doctors assume some babies experience mild gum pain while teething. As the tooth erupts from the gum-line, it causes a break in the gum. This gum pain may be due to bacteria getting into the freshly broken gum. Rubbing the gums: Use a clean finger to apply gentle pressure to the gums.",

Although parents associate certain symptoms with teething, there is no good evidence to support this. In one study, there were many symptoms associated with teething, but none were consistent. The symptoms parents associate with teething the most are: Biting or increased sucking Fussiness Greater drooling Rubbing gums Trouble sleeping Tugging at the ears A rash on the face Less intake of solid foods But none of these symptoms occurred in more than one-third of teething infants. The only thing you should reliably expect when your baby is teething, is teeth. How do I know if my baby is teething or sick? If your child is just fussy, it may be hard to know. When your child has other symptoms, it may help to give a clue. There are no consistent symptoms of teething, but you may see that your child is drooling and biting on objects more often. Teething doesn’t cause symptoms like diarrhea, coughing, or fevers. These are more likely symptoms of an illness. If your child has a fever, their body is probably trying to fight an infection. The fever is a sign your child has a healthy immune system and it is doing what it’s supposed to do. If your baby has fever or symptoms of an illness, you should let their medical provider know so they can find the cause. What should you do to treat a fever in a baby who’s teething? Whether or not your child is teething, the treatment of a fever is the same. Over-the-counter medicines canhelp your child feel comfortable. It takes about 30 minutes for any fever reducing medicine to work, and the maximum effect happens within 1 hour. Let your provider know if your child has fever. If the fever persists or is above 102.2°F (39°C), a medical provider will need to look for an infection. When should you be concerned about your baby's fever? A fever signals your child is sick.",

One of the most challenging aspects of caring for young children is simply not knowing if and when something is wrong with them. Infants and toddlers can’t communicate what they’re feeling or what may be bothering them, so it often becomes a guessing game when parents sense something isn’t right. Is my baby sick? Is she teething? Does she have an earache? Is she constipated? We’re constantly looking for clues that may indicate what’s going on. A new study published in the journal Pediatrics may help us solve one of these longstanding parenting problems. Does a fever tell you that baby is teething? Researchers looked at data from 16 different studies from a variety of countries that were published over the last 45 years. Their goal was to determine which signs and symptoms are related to teething and which aren’t. And while it can’t be determined with 100% accuracy because these studies were each conducted by different healthcare providers in separate settings with unique criteria, looking over the data as a whole can give us a better clue about what is happening when a child is teething. This study shows that there are some reliable indicators of a baby’s teething. Redness, swelling and tenderness around the gums tends to occur, especially in the back of the mouth. Also, general symptoms such as irritability and drooling are common, and the symptoms tend to be less troublesome as the child grows older. Perhaps the most telling from the list of these symptoms, though, is what it does not include- fever. Researchers determined that although a slight increase in a baby’s body temperature was documented around the time a tooth was coming in, the increased temperature was not enough to be considered a fever. If that last statement made you do a double take, you aren’t alone. Wait, you may be thinking, isn’t a fever by definition an increase in body temperature? How can an increase in body temperature not be a fever? It’s because a fever is characterized as a body temperature of 100.4F or greater.",

Many mothers are concerned about the health and comfort of their teething child. This article gives a few tips on teething symptoms and oral care during this rough time for babies. It is the joy of every parent to see their kids develop a healthy and happy smile. Most children will start teething usually around six months of age. Usually the lower front teeth come in first although some children can be delayed up to 15 to 18 months of age before their first tooth erupts, as it is individually dependent on the pace of each child’s dental development. The American Academy of Pediatrics, The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, and the American Dental Association all recommend a first dental visit at age one. Visiting a pediatric dentist is another great resource for your teething questions and overall oral health. Can Teething Cause Fevers? Anecdotally, a number of things are said to cause low-grade rise in body temperature during the teething period, and so the term “teething fever” is often brought up. One among them is the inflammation of the gum during the eruption of new teeth. If your baby experiences a rise in temperature that goes beyond 100° F or has diarrhea, there is a high chance that the child is sick with another disease that is not related to a “teething fever.” In such a case, it is recommended that your child see their pediatrician. An extensive literature review was conducted and published in the Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics looking into the signs and symptoms of primary tooth eruption. For body temperature analyses, tooth eruption could lead to rise in temperatures, but not characterized as fevers. It is always good for parents to have a portable thermometer to check the baby’s temperature in order to monitor the severity of fevers. What are The Causes of Teething Fever?

Outcome measures: Parents daily recorded 2 tympanic temperatures, presence or absence of 18 symptoms, and all tooth eruptions in their infants, from the 4-month well-child visit until the child turned 1 year old. Results: Daily symptom data were available for 19 422 child-days and 475 tooth eruptions. Symptoms were only significantly more frequent in the 4 days before a tooth emergence, the day of the emergence, and 3 days after it, so this 8-day window was defined as the teething period. Increased biting, drooling, gum-rubbing, sucking, irritability, wakefulness, ear-rubbing, facial rash, decreased appetite for solid foods, and mild temperature elevation were all statistically associated with teething. Congestion, sleep disturbance, stool looseness, increased stool number, decreased appetite for liquids, cough, rashes other than facial rashes, fever over 102 degrees F, and vomiting were not significantly associated with tooth emergence. Although many symptoms were associated with teething, no symptom occurred in >35% of teething infants, and no symptom occurred >20% more often in teething than in nonteething infants. No teething child had a fever of 104 degrees F and none had a life-threatening illness. Conclusions: Many mild symptoms previously thought to be associated with teething were found in this study to be temporally associated with teething. However, no symptom cluster could reliably predict the imminent emergence of a tooth. Before caregivers attribute any infants' signs or symptoms of a potentially serious illness to teething, other possible causes must be ruled out.teething, tooth eruption, teeth, deciduous dentition.",

Here's information to help ease the pain — for both of you. What's typical? Although timing varies widely, babies often begin teething by about age 6 months. The two bottom front teeth (lower central incisors) are usually the first to appear, followed by the two top front teeth (upper central incisors). Classic signs and symptoms of teething include: Excessive drooling Chewing on objects Irritability or crankiness Sore or tender gums Slight increase in temperature — but no fever Many parents suspect that teething causes fever and diarrhea, but researchers say these symptoms aren't indications of teething. If your baby has a rectal temperature of 100.4 F (38 C) or diarrhea, talk to the doctor. What's the best way to soothe sore gums? Keep it cool. A cold spoon or chilled — not frozen — teething ring can be soothing on a baby's gums. To avoid cavities, don't dip these items in sugary substances. Try an over-the-counter remedy. If your baby is especially cranky, consider giving him or her infants' or children's over-the-counter pain medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others). What treatments should I avoid? To keep your baby safe, avoid using: Over-the-counter remedies, including homeopathic teething tablets. The benefits of topical gels and teething tablets haven't been demonstrated. In recent years, lab analysis of some homeopathic remedies found greater amounts than labeled of the ingredient belladonna, which can cause seizures and difficulty breathing. Teething medications containing benzocaine or lidocaine. These pain relievers can be harmful — even fatal — to your baby. Do I need to call the doctor? Teething",

It hurts to have those new teeth grow in, and that can lead to a lot of crying, sleepless nights and frustration. What can you do to make it better? Here’s what you need to know about teething, including what’s safe—and not safe—to give your baby. When does teething start—and end? In general, teething starts around 6 months of age, but it varies. It can begin anytime from 6 to 12 months. Your child will be getting new teeth, off and on, for a couple of years. The two sets of front teeth—typically bottom and then top—come in first. The molars (in the back of the mouth) are the last to appear, sometime between the ages of 1 and 3 years. These tend to be more painful. Signs and symptoms Fussiness and crying. Teething hurts! Your baby has good reason to be fussy, irritable and quick to cry. Drooling. Teething stimulates saliva—and drooling. Many babies drool a lot! There isn’t much you can do about this. Just stock up on bibs, and keep your child’s mouth and face as clean and dry as possible. One note: Many babies drool even before their first teeth come in. Just because you see drooling doesn’t mean your baby is teething. Putting things in their mouth. Babies like to do this regardless, but those who are teething will often bite or gnaw on things to ease gum pain. Low-grade fever. Teething can sometimes cause a very mild, low-grade fever. Higher fevers—101 F or above—are not caused by teething. Best remedies for teething pain Something cold. Keep a clean, damp washcloth or small damp towel in the fridge. Once it’s cold, give it to your baby to hold and gnaw on. (You can knot one end to make it easier.)",

Paying attention to your expected service cost lets homeowners budget for upcoming fixes and recognize suspicious pricing (whether too high or too low). For plumber service, it’s important to understand how much plumbers charge for their services and why – and that’s something we’ll discuss this month. How Much Does a Plumber Cost in Florida? The cost for a qualified plumber ranges from $45 to $200 per hour according to HomeAdvisor, with an average of about $330. In Florida, our cost of living is slightly lower – so an average job is closer to $309. However, this range depends on the job type, timing, and quality of the plumber. Overall, common plumbing jobs end up costing $177 to $483 as long as you aren’t making any major replacements, shower installations, or re-piping. What Factors into Plumbing Repair Cost From small plumbing repairs to big projects, several things factor into plumbing prices. The cost of a service call varies from plumbing company to plumbing contractor depending on who you call. These factors help explain why there’s no flat rate per job and the difference between inexpensive plumbers and professionals. Type of Plumbing Service As you can imagine, there’s a big difference between fixing leaky faucets and remodeling projects. Your kitchen sink, main sewer line, garbage disposal, septic tank, water heater, gas lines, and other plumbing systems are all so varied that costs vary depending on what kind of project you have. Basic repairs and plumbing problems will be cheaper – but don’t expect the same for a new shower install. The same is true for residential plumbers and commercial plumbers. Commercial properties have distinct licensing and plumbing rates from residential contractors since the systems, local building codes, and equipment are so different.",

          "snippet": "2025 Plumber Cost Per Hour | Average Rates To Hire A Plumber Average plumber rates are $500 to $800 for large repairs, and $125 to $350 for small jobs like repairing toilets, sinks, faucets, or bathtubs. How Much Are Plumber Union Fees? Plumbers who belong to a union pay dues of $20 to $30 per month. Some unions take a percentage of the plumbers' wages that can be as high as 20%. Roto-Rooter Labor Rates Roto-Rooter doesn’t publish its labor rates online because hourly rates depend on the location of the business—some areas of the country have higher labor rates. Based on online reviews of the service, Roto-Rooter prices are 3X to 4X more than the cost of getting a handyman to do the same work. Hiring a Plumber When it comes to hiring a plumber, you’ll either hire a general plumber who handles basic repairs, or a plumbing contractor who specializes in new construction and remodeling projects. General Plumber A general plumber is who you’ll call when your kitchen sink gets clogged up, or you have a leak or the toilet’s overflowing. Master plumbers typically own plumbing businesses and have the knowledge and experience to handle any problem that might occur. Plumbing Contractor A plumbing contractor handles things like remodels and new construction. They will act as a general contractor and oversee the water, sewer, and gas lines in the new construction project, hiring subcontractors to handle different aspects of the project. Hiring A Plumber Before hiring a plumber, be sure to: Get at least three estimates to compare. Ask for recommendations from family, friends, and neighbors. Read reviews and check out their previous work on HomeGuide and Google. Select companies that are insured, bonded, licensed, and have been in business for 5+ years. Avoid selecting the cheapest quote as quality may suffer. Ask for a written warranty on their work, including any parts. Avoid making large payments up front, and never pay in cash. Questions To Ask Are you licensed, bonded, and insured? How long have you been in business? Can you provide references with contact information? What hours do you work? Do you charge more for after hours and weekend jobs?",

Stan Wawrinka was the reigning champion, but did not participate due to a knee injury that ended his season prematurely. Wawrinka's withdrawal ended his streak of 50 consecutive major appearances, dating back to the 2005 French Open.[2] Reigning finalist Novak Djokovic also withdrew due to an elbow injury that ended his season, ending his streak of 51 consecutive major appearances, dating back to the 2005 Australian Open.[3] Accordingly, this was the first men's singles draw at the US Open since 1971 to include neither finalist from the previous year's tournament. After the loss of Marin Čilić in the third round, a first-time major finalist was guaranteed from the bottom half of the draw. Anderson was the first South African man to reach the final since Cliff Drysdale in 1965, and at any major singles final since Kevin Curren at the 1984 Australian Open, as well as the lowest-ranked man to reach the US Open singles final since the ATP rankings began in 1973.[4][5] Anderson was also the tallest major finalist in history, at 6 feet 8 inches.[6]",

Rafael Nadal Wins the U.S. Open and Brings Superstar Quality Back to Men’s Tennis Rafael Nadal Wins the U.S. Open and Brings Superstar Quality Back to Men’s Tennis 4 minute read Rafael Nadal of Spain poses with the U.S. Open championship trophy after he defeated Kevin Anderson of South Africa in the Men's Singles Finals match on on September 10, 2017 in New York City. Abbie Parr—Getty Images Coming into this year’s tennis season, sports writers and commentators were contemplating career obituaries for Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, rather than predicting that they would sweep the season’s Grand Slams. Who could blame them for preparing for the end of Roger and Rafa, whose stocks were slipping? Nadal’s 2016 results were a dour read: loses the first round at the Australian Open; withdraws from the French Open — where he had won nine titles — with a wrist injury before the third round; misses Wimbledon due to a bum wrist; fails to win a medal at the Rio Olympics; fourth round loss at the U.S. Open; ends the season in October (wrist again). He was 30, a pro for over half his life, with a dossier of injuries to show for it. Meanwhile, Federer, was 35. He had one major victory since 2010, and none since 2012. He had knee surgery in 2016, and lost the last five months of the season to rehab. Nadal and Federer won every Grand Slam tournament in 2006, 2007, and 2010. Now, improbable as it is to believe, you can add 2017 to that ledger. Nadal beat South Africa’s Kevin Anderson in straight sets at the U.S. Open final Sunday evening, 6-3, 6-3, 6-4, to cap off his remarkable Grand Slam campaign.",

As for who popped out of Walt’s mind? Why, that was Mickey Mouse! Just before Walt left New York for the cross-country train ride back to Hollywood, he sent his brother Roy a telegram. Nowhere in it did he outline the possible career-ending blow he and his brother had just sustained. He simply indicated when he would arrive home, and took care to add, “Don’t worry everything OK,” to ease his brother’s nerves. Everything was not okay. Walt knew he had to come up with a new character, and fast. Walt’s daughter Diane Disney Miller recalled, “It was on that long train ride that dad conceived of a new cartoon subject, a mouse who was then refined and further developed by Ub Iwerks, and given his name by my mother.” The first Mickey Mouse cartoon actually completed was Plane Crazy. Inspired by Charles Lindbergh’s heroic first solo flight across the Atlantic, its plot entailed Mickey and some animal friends attempting to assemble their own airplane. The cartoon premiered in Hollywood on May 15, 1928, in the form of a test screening. It failed to obtain distribution. The second Mickey Mouse cartoon, The Gallopin’ Gaucho, met with the same fate. One unpleasant distributor even told Walt, “They don’t know you and they don’t know your mouse.” The third time was the charm for Mickey, however, when Steamboat Willie premiered on November 18, 1928, in New York’s Colony Theatre.",

          "snippet": "Mickey Mouse - Wikipedia Mickey Mouse is an American cartoon character co-created in 1928 by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. The longtime icon and mascot of The Walt Disney Company, Mickey is an anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts, large yellow shoes, and white gloves. Inspired by such silent film personalities as Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks, Mickey is traditionally characterized as a sympathetic underdog who gets by on pluck and ingenuity in the face of challenges bigger than himself.[2] The character’s depiction as a small mouse is personified through his diminutive stature and falsetto voice, the latter of which was originally provided by Disney. Mickey is one of the world's most recognizable and universally acclaimed fictional characters of all time. Origin Mickey Mouse was created as a replacement for Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, an earlier cartoon character that was created by the Disney studio but owned by Universal Pictures.[3]Charles Mintz served as a middleman producer between Disney and Universal through his company, Winkler Pictures, for the series of cartoons starring Oswald. Ongoing conflicts between Disney and Mintz and the revelation that several animators from the Disney studio would eventually leave to work for Mintz's company ultimately resulted in Disney cutting ties with Oswald. Among the few people who stayed at the Disney studio were animator Ub Iwerks, apprentice artist Les Clark, and Wilfred Jackson. On his train ride home from New York, Walt brainstormed ideas for a new cartoon character. Mickey Mouse was conceived in secret while Disney produced the final Oswald cartoons he contractually owed Mintz. Disney asked Ub Iwerks to start drawing up new character ideas. Iwerks tried sketches of various animals, such as dogs and cats, but none of these appealed to Disney. A female cow and male horse were also rejected. (They would later turn up as Clarabelle Cow and Horace Horsecollar.)",

Fifty years after his death, Iwerks' legacy is coming into focus. NOEL KING, HOST: Fifty years ago today, an animator named Ub Iwerks died. He was never a household name, but he is responsible for some of Disney's greatest special effects, and he designed Mickey Mouse. Mackenzie Martin of member station KCUR tells his story on the podcast A People's History Of Kansas City. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED KCUR PODCAST) MACKENZIE MARTIN, BYLINE: When you think about Mickey Mouse, one name comes to mind, Walt Disney. But here's the thing - Walt Disney didn't create Mickey Mouse alone. It was actually his best friend, Ub Iwerks, who designed the iconic cartoon in 1928. JEFF RYAN: Mickey is basically the child of two dads. MARTIN: Jeff Ryan is the author of \"A Mouse Divided: How Ub Iwerks Became Forgotten, And Walt Disney Became Uncle Walt. \" RYAN: He was the person who was doing most of the behind-the-scenes work, and when Walt was taking credit, Ub was the one who was denied credit. MARTIN: It's not like Walt Disney wasn't integral to the success of Mickey Mouse. He certainly was. In addition to defining Mickey's personality, he literally voiced the character for years. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WALT DISNEY: (As Mickey Mouse) He'll hear you. MARTIN: But that doesn't erase the fact that for decades, the collaboration between Iwerks and Disney was mostly kept a secret. RYAN: I think a lot of that has to do with the way that Disney over the years has controlled the Mickey Mouse narrative. They want people to think that Walt was responsible for more than he was actually responsible for. MARTIN:",

          "snippet": "Mickey Mouse | Cartoon, Creation, Disney, & Facts | Britannica Who is Mickey Mouse? Mickey Mouse is the most popular character of Walt Disney’s animated cartoons and arguably the most popular cartoon star in the world. Mickey is often presented as a cheerful and mischievous anthropomorphic rodent. What was Mickey Mouse originally called? Walt Disney named his first iteration of the character Mortimer Mouse. However, at the urging of Lillian Disney, his wife, the character was renamed Mickey Mouse; reportedly, Lillian disliked the name Mortimer for the mouse and suggested Mickey. How was Mickey Mouse created? Walt Disney began his first series of fully animated films in 1927, featuring the character Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. When his distributor appropriated the rights to the character, Disney altered Oswald’s appearance and created a new character that ultimately became Mickey Mouse. Mickey made his first appearance in 1928. Who has voiced Mickey Mouse? Mickey Mouse was voiced by just three voice actors between 1929 and 2009. Walt Disney lent his voice to Mickey beginning in 1929. Jimmy MacDonald took over in 1946. Wayne Allwine voiced Mickey beginning in 1983 and continued for the next 32 years, until his death in 2009. Bret Iwan then became the official voice for Mickey. Beginning in 2013, Chris Diamantopolous provided the voice for the eponymous Mickey Mouse television show. Why is Mickey Mouse so popular? Mickey Mouse’s enduring popularity can likely be credited to the way he ubiquitously represents wholesome values of kindness and innocence. It can also be credited to the Walt Disney Company’s unprecedented success in marketing his likeness through a variety of merchandise, which made Mickey Mouse one of the most lucrative cartoon characters in history.

Here are sixfacts about the world’s most iconic critter. 1. He started off as a rabbit Before Walt Disney created Mickey Mouse, he made Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. But in a dispute with his business partner at Universal, Disney lost the rights to Oswald. The loss of his first character inspired the birth of the Mouse. If you look at the two characters, you can see the resemblance. Red shorts, big ears and wide eyes sound familiar? 2. He’s married to Minnie Yes, married. While there was never a wedding in any film, Disney decided in the studio that the two mice already were happily hitched. Like any loving couple would want, Mickey and Minnie shared their big screen debut together in “Steamboat Willie” in 1928. Every year on November 18, they get to celebrate their birthdays together.

Walt Disney Actually Lied About Creating Mickey Mouse Anyone who is a Disney fan loves Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse. The duo went on to be household names of the Walt Disney Company. But what if we told you that Walt Disney wasn’t actually the one who created Mickey Mouse. Animator Ub Iwerks was a Kansas City native known for some of the most iconic scenes of all time, including those in Disney’s Mary Poppins and Sleeping Beauty, as well as Alfred Hitchcock‘s The Birds. But what Iwerks doesn’t get credit for is creating the one and only Mickey Mouse. That’s right, Kansas City animator Ub Iwerks is the one who designed Mickey Mouse in 1928 and single-handedly animated the first Mickey cartoon in Hollywood. Meaning all of those stories about how Mickey was inspired by a pet mouse that Walt Disney had in Kansas City at the Laugh-O-Gram Studios, or that Disney came up with the idea of Mickey Mouse while on a train from New York to California, are, in fact, false. According to reports, Iwerks’s granddaughter Leslie Iwerks, said “[Ub Iwerks] said that it was not Walt creating the character on a train… So that was a very different story than the Disney company had put out or that Walt started telling after Mickey became successful.” The real story of how Mickey Mouse was created is a simple one – the iconic mouse was born during an extremely tense, stressful moment. Walt Disney had just lost the rights to his first hit character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, and all of his animators had abandoned him. Everyone except the Oswald co-creator, Ub Iwerks, who is the real person behind Mickey Mouse’s creation. But because Disney took the credit of creating Mickey Mouse, and did not give credit to Iwerks, it led to the friendship ending and Iwerks leaving Walt Disney Studios to start his own animation studio, citing “personal differences with Walt.” Did you know that Walt Disney didn’t actually create Mickey Mouse single handedly?",

          "snippet": "Walt Disney stole the idea for Mickey Mouse off his friend Contact The Author Walt Disney gets sole credit for history's most famous mouse, but there's more to the story. Getty Images According to Walt Disney, the idea for Mickey Mouse suddenly popped into his head on a 1928 cross-country train ride “when the business fortunes of my brother Roy and myself were at [their] lowest ebb,” as he wrote in 1948. Nice story. It’s become part of American lore. But it’s not true. In reality, Mickey Mouse was created by an animator named Ub Iwerks — sketched in March 1928 on an ordinary piece of two-hole punch paper in less than an hour. Iwerks has been largely forgotten by the general public, his place in creating the Disney brand downplayed. Walt made sure of that, says a new book, “A Mouse Divided” by Jeff Ryan (Post Hill Press), out Tuesday. “After [Walt and Ub’s] acrimonious breakup, Walt started telling a story that he had made up Mickey solo, leaving Iwerks out of the equation,” Ryan tells The Post. “As he kept adding to it, people began to realize it wasn’t true. Walt knew what audiences wanted wasn’t the unglamorous truth but a legend, a myth.” Walt and Ub, whose full name is Ubbe (pronounced “oob”) Iwwerks, started out as best friends. The two men met in Kansas City in 1919 while working at an art studio. They soon launched their own animation venture, producing cartoon shorts that were screened before feature films. Their biggest success was Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, but the men lost control of the character after a disagreement with a distributor. A replacement was needed. Walt and Ub sat down and began brainstorming. Ub drew a horse, a cow, a frog and a dog, but none worked. Finally, Walt suggested a mouse. Ub went to work and soon filled a piece of paper, divided into six panels, with various versions. One looked more rat-like, with a long, thin snout.",

          "snippet": "Mickey Mouse turns 90 | National Museum of American History In 1923, Walt and his brother Roy founded a small animation studio in Hollywood. Disney landed a deal with Universal Pictures through a distributor, creating a series of funny animal cartoons. One of his creations, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, became an overnight sensation. The success of Oswald encouraged Disney to ask for a raise, but instead the distributor claimed Oswald as its own. Disney was out of a job. Disappointed but not deterred, Disney, along with his friend and fellow animator Ub Iwerks, co-created a new cartoon character: Mickey Mouse. There are multiple stories about how Disney and Iwerks chose the name “Mickey” for their new character. One story is that the men originally chose the name Mortimer, but that Disney’s wife convinced him to change the name to Mickey. An arguably more believable story is that the men based the mouse on a wooden toy, patented in 1926 by Rene D. Grove for the Performo-Toy Co., Inc., that had the name “Micky” written in a red circle across its chest. Lesson learned from his experience with Oswald, Disney promptly registered his character with the U.S. Patent Office. In May 1928, Disney produced his first silent cartoon short, Plane Crazy, starring his new anthropomorphic character, Mickey Mouse. The cartoon was not well received by the studio, so it was put aside. Six months later, Mickey Mouse finally made his public debut in the black-and-white film short Steamboat Willie.

The two last presidential elections, which brought President Biden, now 82, and former President Donald Trump, now 78, to the White House, are proof of this political reality. The Founding Fathers excluded a maximum age limit from the Constitution, giving those in their golden years the ability to run for the highest office in the land. Here's a look at the history of the oldest presidents — in the Oval Office and beyond: Who were the oldest U.S. presidents at election and in office? The two oldest presidents ever to be sworn in are Mr. Biden, who was 78 when he took office in 2021, and Trump, who was 70 on his Inauguration Day in 2017. When he takes office next month, now President-elect Trump will eclipse Mr. Biden by a few months as the oldest president ever sworn in at his Inauguration in January, six months before his 79th birthday. The third oldest president at his inauguration was Ronald Reagan, who was 69 when he was sworn in in 1981. \"I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience,\" Reagan famously said in 1984 while running for reelection against Walter Mondale. In fourth place is the nation's ninth president, William Henry Harrison. Harrison was elected in 1841 at age 68, but his tenure as president was short-lived. He died 32 days into his first term, making his presidency the shortest in U.S. history. Who are the oldest living U.S. presidents? The oldest living president is Mr. Biden, who turned 82 on Nov. 20, just weeks after the election. Three former presidents, George W.

For more details, visit our website. Age of U.S. Presidents when taking office 1789-2025 Since 1789, 45 different men have served as President of the United States, and the average age of these men when taking office for the first time was approximately 57 years. Two men, Grover Cleveland and Donald Trump, were elected to two non-consecutive terms, and Donald Trump's victory in 2024 made him the oldest man ever elected as president, where he will be 78 years and seven months old when taking office again. Record holders The oldest president to take office for the first time was Joe Biden in 2021, at 78 years and two months - around five months younger than Donald Trump when he assumes office in 2025. The youngest presidents to take office were Theodore Roosevelt in 1901 (42 years and 322 days), who assumed office following the assassination of William McKinley, and the youngest elected president was John F Kennedy in 1961 (43 years and 236 days). Historically, there seems to be little correlation between age and electability, and the past five presidents have included the two oldest to ever take office, and two of the youngest. Requirements to become president The United States Constitution states that both the President and Vice President must be at least 35 years old when taking office, and must have lived in the United States for at least 14 years of their life. Such restrictions are also in place for members of the U.S. Congress, although the age and residency barriers are lower. Additionally, for the roles of President and Vice President, there is a \"natural-born-citizen\" clause that was traditionally interpreted to mean candidates must have been born in the U.S. (or were citizens when the Constitution was adopted).",

Author: Andrew Weil Published: 8:45 AM CST November 20, 2024 Updated: 8:50 AM CST November 20, 2024 WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is celebrating his 82nd birthday on Wednesday, further cementing his status as the oldest serving U.S. president. But it's a record that Donald Trump could one day break in a few years. Concerns over Biden’s age permeated both parties through the 2024 election up until he abruptly dropped out of the race. Now president-elect Trump will become the oldest person ever sworn into office on Jan. 20, 2025. That's a milestone previously held by Biden when he was sworn in at age 78 back in 2021. Who is the oldest living U.S. president? Jimmy Carter, the 39th President of the United States, became the first U.S. president to turn 100 years old last month. We're a ways away from any other living U.S. president even coming close to that record. Biden, the second-oldest living president behind Carter, wouldn't celebrate his 100th birthday until Nov. 20, 2042.",

The biography for President Harrison and past presidents is courtesy of the White House Historical Association. William Henry Harrison, an American military officer and politician, was the ninth President of the United States (1841), the oldest President to be elected at the time. On his 32nd day, he became the first to die in office, serving the shortest tenure in U.S. Presidential history. “Give him a barrel of hard cider and settle a pension of two thousand a year on him, and my word for it,” a Democratic newspaper foolishly gibed, “he will sit … by the side of a ‘sea coal’ fire, and study moral philosophy. ” The Whigs, seizing on this political misstep, in 1840 presented their candidate William Henry Harrison as a simple frontier Indian fighter, living in a log cabin and drinking cider, in sharp contrast to an aristocratic champagne-sipping Van Buren. Harrison was in fact a scion of the Virginia planter aristocracy. He was born at Berkeley in 1773. He studied classics and history at Hampden-Sydney College, then began the study of medicine in Richmond. Suddenly, that same year, 1791, Harrison switched interests. He obtained a commission as ensign in the First Infantry of the Regular Army, and headed to the Northwest, where he spent much of his life. In the campaign against the Indians, Harrison served as aide-de-camp to General “Mad Anthony” Wayne at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, which opened most of the Ohio area to settlement. After resigning from the Army in 1798, he became Secretary of the Northwest Territory, was its first delegate to Congress, and helped obtain legislation dividing the Territory into the Northwest and Indiana Territories. In 1801 he became Governor of the Indiana Territory, serving 12 years. His prime task as governor was to obtain title to Indian lands so settlers could press forward into the wilderness. When the Indians retaliated, Harrison was responsible for defending the settlements. The threat against settlers became serious in 1809.",

Donald Trump: Oldest person to be elected US President Donald Trump, after being convicted of a felony and surviving two assassination attempts, secured a second term as US President, defeating Kamala Harris's bid to become the first female president. His victory, fueled by unwavering support despite legal battles, marks him as the oldest person to assume the presidency. Trump's return follows a tumultuous period since his 2020 election loss, including the January 6th Capitol riot and ongoing legal challenges. Donald Trump went from being a businessman, real estate tycoon and a reality TV star to becoming the country's first former US President to be declared a convicted felon. And after surviving two assassination bids during his 2024 campaign, the 78-year old remains unstoppable with American voters giving him a second term. In the process, he shattered the dream of the Democratic Party, as well as that of millions of Kamala Harris supporters, to finally have the first woman President in the White House. He is now the oldest person in US history to be elected president. From the time he left office after his loss in the 2020 presidential election to his nomination as the Republican candidate in the 2024 race, Trump continued to dominate the American news cycle and the country's psyche. He refused to accept the November 2020 result that brought Joe Biden to the White House, and a stunned nation watched his supporters storm the US Capitol on January 6. The riots disrupted a joint session of the US Congress which was in the process of affirming the presidential election results. His third run for the job in 2024 was characterised by a slew of indictments and criminal cases, and a conviction in a New York court -- making him the first former US president to be held guilty of a crime. A grand jury found him guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records. The Biden-Harris campaign said at the time that no one is above the law while Trump called the verdict the result of a \"rigged\" political system.",

The plan had already been phased out in Canada and the U.K. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Netflix is removing its cheapest ad-free plan for subscribers in the U.S. and France. The change was announced Thursday as part of the streaming giant's second-quarter earnings report. The basic plan was $11.99 per month, and had already been phased out for subscribers in Canada and the U.K. The company stopped allowing new sign-ups for the basic plan in July 2023, but existing subscribers were allowed to keep the plan until now. Basic plan subscribers can switch to the ad-free Standard plan, which is $15.49 per month, or downgrade to the ad-supported plan that is $6.99 per month, which was launched in November 2022. There is also a premium plan for $22.99 per month. The basic plan was the only tier that didn’t allow multiple users to stream simultaneously. When asked about the results of phasing out the basic plan in Canada and the U.K., Greg Peters, co-CEO of Netflix, said that the Standard with ads plan has seen success since its launch. “Essentially, we're providing them a better experience, two streams versus one. We've got higher definition. We got downloads. And, of course, all at a lower price, $6.99 in the United States. We think that represents a tremendous entertainment value. And it includes ads,” Peters said. “And for members who don't want that ads experience, they, of course, can choose our ads-free standard or premium plans as well.” Netflix reported a record 277.65 million subscribers globally across all of its tier options in the earnings report.

Netflix to Start the Phase-Out of Its Basic Ad-Free Plan in the US Legacy subscribers in the US and France will need to select a new plan. Kourtnee JacksonSenior Editor Kourtnee covers TV streaming services and home entertainment news and reviews at CNET. She previously worked as an entertainment reporter at Showbiz Cheat Sheet where she wrote about film, television, music, celebrities, and streaming platforms. Netflix is continuing to sunset its Basic ad-free option for customers, extending the process to existing subscribers in the US and France. The streaming giant announced the move in a letter to shareholders on Thursday and discussed it during its second-quarter earnings call. Affected customers in the US -- legacy users who haven't canceled their Basic ad-free subscriptions -- will begin to see emails encouraging them to select a new plan. The announcement about sunsetting this subscription plan is not new. The streamer dropped its Basic commercial-free tier for new subscribers in the US and UK in July 2023 and followed up last October with a price increase for legacy customers with the subscription. The price was bumped up to $12 per month for existing customers in the US who opted to keep the plan, with increases in the UK and France as well. The streamer initially announced its decision to completely phase it out in a letter to shareholders earlier this year, and started the permanent discontinuation in the UK and Canada in the second quarter of 2024. Users have begun to see on-screen notifications showing a deadline to upgrade subscriptions. Additionally, Netflix started moving forward with shutting down the Basic subscription option in select regions where the ad-based version is available. With the new change this year, US subscribers will have three plans to choose from: Basic With Ads ($7 per month), ad-free Standard ($15.50 a month) or Premium ($23 per month).

While it once scoffed at the possibility of offering an ad-supported tier, Netflix has since embraced the idea, with millions of users snapping up its “Standard with Ads” plan while garnering plenty of interest from Madison Avenue. Having recently celebrated its second anniversary, Netflix’s ad-supported tier has added a variety of features that set it apart from the streaming crowd–and for now, its price remains a fraction of Netflix’s priciest 4K streaming plan. So, how much does Netflix with ads cost, and what’s included? Here’s what you need to know. How much does Netflix with ads cost? Netflix Standard with Ads costs $6.99 a month, a price that has remained unchanged since last year’s launch. Does ad-supported Netflix offer downloads for offline viewing? One of the best perks offered by the big streamers is the ability to download their videos for offline viewing, perfect for binge-watching your favorite series during a long flight or when you don’t want to bust through your data cap. Until recently, Netflix didn’t allow its with-ads subscribers to download videos for offline viewing, a restriction shared by the other big streamers. But in November 2023, Netflix reversed course, becoming the first big streaming service to enable offline downloads for subscribers to its ad-supported tier. There is a monthly limit to downloads for Standard with Ads subscribers, however: 15 downloads per device, resetting on the first of the month. How many commercial breaks does Netflix with ads have? Netflix Standard with Ads subscribers will have to sit through 4-5 minutes of commercials per hour, with the ads running at the beginning and during videos (ideally during “natural plot breaks”). Each ad will be either 15 or 30 seconds. You will get some ad-free episodes as a bonus for binge-watching, however.",

Clendenin/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images CNN — Netflix will start phasing out its Basic plan, its cheapest advertising-free plan, which costs $11.99 per month in the United States, the company said on Thursday. The company had previously stopped accepting new sign-ups for the Basic plan, instead pushing customers to Netflix’s ad-supported plan, which costs $6.99 per month.

On Thursday, the company said the US and France are next. Basic users in the US who want an ad-free viewing experience on Netflix will now have two choices: Netflix’s Standard plan, which costs $15.49 per month, and its Premium plan, which costs $22.99 per month. Netflix said its cheapest, ad-supported tier, its “Standard with ads” plan, saw a 34% jump in sign-ups in the second quarter of this year. The company reported a record-high 277.65 million subscribers on its streaming platform Thursday, far outpacing streaming competitors like Disney+, Peacock and Max (which is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, CNN’s parent company). Overall, Netflix added 8.05 million new subscribers in its second quarter. Netflix’s surge in new subscribers has been fueled in part by the company’s effort to push users who share passwords to create their own accounts. However, the short-term subscriber jolt from the password-sharing crackdown could soon fade. On Thursday, Netflix said it expects the pace of its subscriber additions to slow in the third quarter.",

          "snippet": "Good Morning Good Morning - Wikipedia \"Good Morning Good Morning\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Lennon himself was critical of the track. \"It's a throwaway, a piece of garbage, I always thought,\" he once said. \"I always had the TV on very low in the background when I was writing, and it came over, and then I wrote the song.\"[7] Recording The basic track was recorded on 8 February 1967, with overdubs on 16 February (bass guitar and lead vocals), 13 March (brass section), 28 March (backing vocals and guitar solo), and 29 March (animal noises).[8] The guitar solo was played by Paul McCartney on a Fender Esquire.[8][9][10] At Lennon's request, George Martin brought in Sounds Incorporated to provide the song's prominent brass backing.[6] Take eight, which contains Lennon's vocals from the subsequent session but also omits animal sounds, was released on Anthology 2 in 1996. Lennon asked engineer Geoff Emerick to arrange the animal noises heard at beginning (and end) of the song so that each animal heard was one capable of devouring (or frightening) the animal preceding it.[6][9] The final sound effect of a chicken clucking was so placed that it transforms into the guitar on the following track, \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)\". According to Emerick, these animal noises were inspired by the coda of \"Caroline, No\" that ended the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds album.[11] They begin with the crow of a rooster, while the other animal sounds heard at the end of the song include birds, a cat, a dog, a cow, a horse, a sheep, a group of bloodhounds accompanying fox hunters on horseback with horns blasting, and a chicken. The rapid 16th note bass drum fills were done on two bass drums, according to Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn.[12] The length of the mono version of \"Good Morning Good Morning\" is 2:35, whereas the stereo version (due to a lengthier fade out of animal sounds) runs to 2:41.",

More Than 1 Billion Active Instagram Users Instagram began in 2010. It reached 100 million active users in February 2013 - a number that people considered excellent at the time. In March 2014, Instagram usage reached 200 million users. It reached 300 million users in December 2014, 400 million in September 2015, 500 million in June 2016, 600 million in December 2016, 700 million in April 2017, and, in January 2021, it surpassed the 1 billion user mark. 2. India Has the Biggest Audience As of July 2021, India is the country with the biggest Instagram audience size (180 million users). This number, however, is just slightly higher than the audience size in the United States where 170 million users access the photo-sharing and editing app. Brazil is in the third spot with 110 million users. 3. Instagram Is One of the Top 10 Most Visited Websites According to SEMrush, Instagram.com attracts close to 4 billion visits. The average time spent per visit is 17 minutes and 23 seconds. This landed them the 8th spot on SEMrush’s list of the world’s most visited websites. On the other hand, Similarweb’s data ranked Instagram even higher and placed its website in the 5th position.",

It only takes one click! Starring a repo is easy and satisfying for both you and its owner. Stars are a good way to get a quick sense of a repository’s popularity. People get pretty obsessed with tracking stars. If you want to chart your stars over time, there’s star-history: star-history is the “missing star history graph of github repos.” I’m a fan of the xkcd-style graphs. If you want to see how you stack up compared to other users, organizations and repos, there’s Gitstar Ranking: With over a million stars across all its repos, google is #1. I have a more modest 6,678, good enough for a rank of 967. But is the sum of stars across repos the best metric for measuring impact? Just one popular repo can push an organization to the top of this list. freeCodeCamp is at #8 with 344k stars. But 308k (nearly 90%) of those come from just one repo. What if we want to find organizations with many popular repos? Academics face the same problem in measuring the impact of authors and journals. They’ve come up with a clever solution call the h-index. It’s best explained through an example: if you have ten published articles with more than ten citations each, then your h-index is ten. This eliminates the problem of a single popular article: if you’ve only written one article then your h-index is one, no matter how popular it is. I thought it would be interesting to measure the h-index of GitHub users and organizations. First step: assemble a list of all the GitHub repos! If you have a list of all the repos with 15 or more stars, then you can find all the organizations with an h-index of 15 or higher. There are around a million of these, so this is a large but not enormous data set. I’d hoped to find a CSV file with this sort of data: just the repo name and star count would be enough.

It also allows us to make repositories, commits, branches, and pull requests. With such great community contribution comes the problem to find the most helpful repos. So I thought of making a curated blog having the list of most helpful repos ever, which will be updated from time to time also! Some of the repos will be including helpful resources while some will help you become a better software engineer and developer. So without any further ado, let’s get started. 1. Public APIs Github Stars: 105K As the name suggests, Public API contains a list of free APIs which can be used for building projects and apps. Animals, Games & Comics, Machine Learning, Music, News, Open Source Projects, Photography, Sports ,etc. This is a comprehensive collection of data so go and check it out now. 2. Build your own x You must have guessed it by the name, this is the repository every developer may want! Do you want to invent your own programming language or your own Git? If yes, then go forward to fork this repo. It’s a collection of tutorials on how you can build your own technology. This is a fantastic repository for your project so go and check it out now. 3. Automatic Udemy Course Enroller So this is the repository every student/learner or any learning freak who wants to LEARN NEW STUFF for FREE should have a look.",

          "snippet": "\"GitHub Stars\" is a very useful metric. But for *what GitHub Stars are an easy metric to keep track of, and I've used them to measure how popular an open source project is. Users on the GitHub website are able to \"star\" other people's repositories, thereby saving them in their list of Starred Repos. Some people use \"stars\" to indicate that they like a project, other people use them as bookmarks so they can follow what's going on with the repo later. GitHub Stars are an easy metric to keep track of, and I've used them to measure how popular an open source project is. I admit to sometimes even using Stars to determine how battle-tested a repo is, under the assumption that a repo that has received more Stars must have received more use. However, there are three limitations I noticed with GitHub stars (which makes my current approach to handling them pretty dubious): It is easy to create fake accounts on GitHub that can star repos. This can allow you to boost your metrics pretty easily, although you do not want to be obvious when doing them, lest the accounts get detected and deleted. (You can google for \"buy GitHub stars\" for those that are lazy technically). While you can use fake accounts to star your own repos, you may also want to star other people's repos to avoid leaving a paper trail. And since you don't want to be running all these fake accounts manually, you want to create bots and...you get the picture. GitHub Stars may be \"juiced\" by media attention, which is temporary and not actually based on sustained popularity. This is from personal experience -- after publicizing a fork of an my open source repo on Hacker News, I received some stars, but no corresponding increase in use of my fork. It's possible that a few people were interested in my repo, starred it, and then either never found an actual use case for my fork or promptly forgot about it later on. You can star a Repo for any reason. GitHub doesn't care. It merely notes that someone pressed the Star button and that's all. You can guess why it's starred (someone likes it or wants to look at it later), but other reasons are equally plausible (they are bored at work and like starring random repos, they want to star a repo of a friend of theirs). I'm sure that metric means something. I'm not sure what though.",

The family moved to Midland, Texas, where the senior Bush entered the oil exploration business. The son spent formative years there, attended Midland public schools, and formed friendships that stayed with him into the White House. Bush graduated from Yale, received a business degree from Harvard, and then returned to Midland where he too got into the oil business. In Midland he met and married Laura Welch, a teacher and librarian. They had twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, now out of college and pursuing careers. When George W. Bush, at the age of 54, became the 43rd president of the United States, it was only the second time in American history that a president’s son went on to the White House. John Quincy Adams, elected the sixth president in 1824, was the son of John Adams, the second president. While John Adams had groomed his son to be president, George Bush, the 41st president, insisted he was surprised when the eldest of his six children became interested in politics, became governor of Texas, and then went on to the White House. During the early part of the 2000 campaign for the White House, Bush enjoyed a double-digit lead in the polls over his opponent Vice President Al Gore Jr. But the gap closed as the election approached and though Gore finally won the popular vote by 543,895 votes, victory or loss of the presidency hinged on Florida’s electoral votes. That struggle through recounts and lawsuits worked its way to the Supreme Court. In the end Bush won the electoral count 271 to 266. His new administration was focused on “compassionate conservatism,” which embraced excellence in education, tax relief and volunteerism among faith-based and community organizations. Bush was challenged in his re-election bid in 2004 by Massachusetts Democratic Senator John Kerry. The election was a good contest, but Bush’s contention that the invasion of Iraq had made the world more secure against terrorism won the national political debate. Bush was re-elected with 51 percent to 48 percent.",

Bush perching on the arm and Jeb Bush standing center. In May 1968, two weeks before his graduation from Yale and the expiration of his student draft deferment, Bush applied as a pilot trainee in the Texas Air National Guard, whose members were less likely than regular soldiers to fight in the Vietnam War. Commissioned a second lieutenant in July 1968, he became a certified fighter pilot in June 1970. In the fall of 1970, he applied for admission to the University of Texas law school but was rejected. Although Bush apparently missed at least eight months of duty between May 1972 and May 1973, he was granted an early discharge so that he could start Harvard Business School in the fall of 1973. His spotty military record resurfaced as a campaign issue in both the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections. After receiving an M.B.A. from Harvard in 1975, Bush returned to Midland, where he began working for a Bush family friend, an oil and gas attorney, and later started his own oil and gas firm. He married Laura Welch, a teacher and librarian, in Midland in 1977. After an unsuccessful run for Congress in 1978, Bush devoted himself to building his business. With help from his uncle, who was then raising funds for Bush’s father’s campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, Bush was able to attract numerous prominent investors. The company struggled through the early 1980s until the eventual collapse of oil prices in 1986, when it was purchased by the Harken Energy Corporation. Bush received Harken stock, a job as a consultant to the company, and a seat on the company’s board of directors. In the same year, shortly after his 40th birthday, Bush gave up drinking alcohol.",

Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, members of the Supreme Court and diplomatic corps, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens: Today our nation lost a beloved, graceful, courageous woman who called America to its founding ideals and carried on a noble dream. Tonight we are comforted by the hope of a glad reunion with the husband who was taken so long ago, and we are grateful for the good life of Coretta Scott King. (Applause.) Every time I'm invited to this rostrum, I'm humbled by the privilege, and mindful of the history we've seen together. We have gathered under this Capitol dome in moments of national mourning and national achievement. We have served America through one of the most consequential periods of our history -- and it has been my honor to serve with you. In a system of two parties, two chambers, and two elected branches, there will always be differences and debate. But even tough debates can be conducted in a civil tone, and our differences cannot be allowed to harden into anger. To confront the great issues before us, we must act in a spirit of goodwill and respect for one another -- and I will do my part. Tonight the state of our Union is strong -- and together we will make it stronger. (Applause.) In this decisive year, you and I will make choices that determine both the future and the character of our country. We will choose to act confidently in pursuing the enemies of freedom -- or retreat from our duties in the hope of an easier life. We will choose to build our prosperity by leading the world economy -- or shut ourselves off from trade and opportunity.",

Biography A World Transformed Sworn in as the 41st President of the United States on January 20, 1989, George Herbert Walker Bush helped usher in a new and more hopeful geopolitical era marked by the spread of freedom and free markets. During his historic term in office, the West prevailed in the Cold War; the Soviet Union gave way to a democratic Russia; the Berlin Wall “fell” and Germany was unified within NATO; and President Bush signed two treaties to drastically reduce the threat of nuclear war. After Iraq’s unprovoked invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Mr. Bush forged an unprecedented coalition of disparate nations to uphold international law. His deft handling of this international crisis enabled him to convene the Madrid Peace Conference later in 1991. Throughout his presidency, George Bush worked closely with his international counterparts, including Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, in ways that advanced America’s interests in peace and economic opportunity. \"To Make Kinder the Face of the Nation\" President Bush was the first sitting vice president to ascend to the presidency since 1837, and he was also only the second American president to serve a full term without party control in either chamber of Congress. Nevertheless, President Bush worked with Congress to pass the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Clean Air Act — landmark civil rights and environmental legislation. He also successfully fought for and negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which was later signed into law. The education summit Mr. Bush hosted in 1989 with all 50 U.S. governors at the University of Virginia helped to spur a national reform movement. The 1990 budget agreement he signed codified into law real caps on discretionary spending by Congress while cutting the deficit by historic levels. Points of Light As president, Mr. Bush launched his “Points of Light” initiative to promote volunteerism and community service across America, and during his term in office he named 1,020 Daily Points of Light hailing from all 50 states.

He was also the youngest laureate for any Nobel prize until 2014 (when Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize at the age of 17).[6] The oldest Nobel Prize laureate in physics was Arthur Ashkin who was 96 years old when he was awarded the prize in 2018.[7] There have been six years for which the Nobel Prize in Physics was not awarded (1916, 1931, 1934, 1940–1942). There were also nine years for which the Nobel Prize in Physics was delayed for one year: The 1914 prize awarded to Max von Laue was announced only in November 1915.[9] The Prize was not awarded in 1917, as the Nobel Committee for Physics decided that none of that year's nominations met the necessary criteria, but was awarded to Charles Glover Barkla in 1918 and counted as the 1917 prize.[10] This precedent was followed for the 1918 prize awarded to Max Planck in 1919,[11] \"for his decisive contributions to elementary particle physics, in particular the discovery of a large number of resonance states, made possible through his development of the technique of using hydrogen bubble chamber and data analysis\" \"for their pioneering investigations concerning deep inelastic scattering of electrons on protons and bound neutrons, which have been of essential importance for the development of the quark model in particle physics\" \"for the theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles, and which recently was confirmed through the discovery of the predicted fundamental particle, by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN's Large Hadron Collider\" See also Notes ^The form and spelling of the names are taken from the official website of the Nobel Foundation.

The front side of the medal displays the same profile of Alfred Nobel depicted on the medals for Physics, Chemistry, and Literature. The first Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to German physicist Wilhelm Röntgen in recognition of the extraordinary services he rendered by the discovery of X-rays. This award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and is widely regarded as the most prestigious award that a scientist can receive in physics. It is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on the 10th of December, the anniversary of Nobel's death. As of 2024[update], a total of 226 individuals have been awarded the prize.[2] Background Alfred Nobel, in his last will and testament, stated that his wealth should be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in the fields of physics, chemistry, peace, physiology or medicine, and literature.[3] Though Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime, the last one was written a year before he died and was signed at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in Paris on 27 November 1895.[4][5] Nobel bequeathed 94% of his total assets, 31 million Swedish kronor (US$2.9 million, or €2.7 million in 2023), to establish and endow the five Nobel Prizes.[6] Owing to the level of skepticism surrounding the will, it was not until 26 April 1897 that it was approved by the Storting (Norwegian Parliament).[7][8] The executors of his will were Ragnar Sohlman and Rudolf Lilljequist, who formed the Nobel Foundation to take care of Nobel's fortune and organise the prizes. The members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee who were to award the Peace Prize were appointed soon after the will was approved. The other prize-awarding organisations followed: Karolinska Institutet on 7 June, the Swedish Academy on 9 June, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on 11 June.[9][10]",

Per a press release issued by The Royal Swedish Academy of Science, \"Baker has succeeded with the almost impossible feat of building entirely new kinds of proteins. Hassabis and Jumper have developed an AI model to solve a 50-year-old problem: predicting proteins’ complex structures. These discoveries hold enormous potential. \" Hailing from the U.S., Baker was born in Seattle, WA, and Jumper was born in Little Rock, AR. Meanwhile, Hassabis hails from London, U.K. Hassabis and Jumper featured on the 2024 TIME100 AI list. Commenting on the trio's achievements, Heiner Linke, the Chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said: “One of the discoveries being recognised this year concerns the construction of spectacular proteins. The other is about fulfilling a 50-year-old dream: predicting protein structures from their amino acid sequences. Both of these discoveries open up vast possibilities. \" Literature Han Kang was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday for her “intense poetic prose” focusing on “historical traumas,” colonial violence, and the “fragility” of humanity, per a press release by The Royal Swedish Academy. The South Korean author is known for works such as The Vegetarian—which won the International Booker prize in 2016—The White Book,Human Acts, and Greek Lessons.

Mortgage Loans Mortgage Loans - Overview Breadcrumb What to know before you buy Apply Before You Buy When you are planning on purchasing a home, the first thing you should do is apply for a mortgage loan. Having a preapproved mortgage loan has many advantages. The lender can help you determine the price range of a home you can afford and how much money you will need for a down payment and closing costs. Shop for a loan, not a lender. You may have a long-term relationship with your bank, but that doesn't mean they will give you the best deal. Most loans are sold on the secondary market, so the financial institution that gives you the loan might not be the one that owns and services it for the next 30 years. The more knowledgeable you are before you approach lenders, the better deal you're likely to get. Look in your local paper to see what rates are being offered. Interview lenders over the telephone before meeting with them in person. Find out if they are the actual lender or a broker. A mortgage broker acts as a third party between you and the lender and there will be extra fees for his services. Do a background check on the lender you choose. It's crucial that you check out a company's past. What Information Should You Take to the Lender? Your lender will need to know how much money you have coming in and how much money you pay out in expenses each month. When you apply for a mortgage loan, take the following information with you: Your addresses for the past two years. If you're renting now, bring the name and address of your landlord. Your employers for the last two years. Bring your pay stubs for the past few months. Bring a copy of your tax forms for the last two years; any divorce papers to show alimony or child support you receive; retirement benefit information; and information on any other income you have. If you are self-employed, you will need a certified profit and loss statement. Bank account numbers and balances as well as information about any other savings or investments you have. The year, make, and value of any vehicles you own.",

FAQ A mortgage is a type of loan that is used to buy or refinance a home or property. There are many types of mortgage loans, but it's easy to understand their unique features and benefits with a useful mortgage comparison. Knowing the differences between the types of mortgages can help you prepare to apply for a mortgage loan when you find a home or property you love. Mortgage loans are offered by lenders to qualifying borrowers. A borrower pays back the mortgage over an agreed length of time called a “term”. Lenders will typically loan mortgages to borrowers based on a variety of qualifying factors that can include credit score, debt to income ratio and credit history. You can strengthen your ability to qualify for a mortgage by monitoring your credit score and take steps to get your score as high as possible prior to applying for a mortgage.

Come in A preapproval is based on a review of income and asset information you provide, your credit report and an automated underwriting system review. The issuance of a preapproval letter is not a loan commitment or a guarantee for loan approval. We may offer a loan commitment after you submit an application and we perform a final underwriting review, including verification of any information provided, property valuation and, if applicable, investor approval, which may result in a change to the terms of your preapproval.

If you are an SCRA-eligible customer and have questions about the SCRA or about refinancing, please discuss with your Home Lending Advisor.

Footnote3 Debt Consolidation Information: The amount you save on debt consolidation may vary by loan. Since a home loan or cash-out refinance may have a longer term than some of the bills you may be consolidating, you may not realize a savings over the entire term of your new loan.

On 20 March 2011, \"The Chain\" peaked higher at number 81 in the UK chart following a campaign on Facebook to try to get the song to number 1 for the start of the 2011 Formula One season.[5] Excerpts from The Chain were also used in the official trailer for the film F1 (2025) a film based around Formula One.[37] Background and recording Tantric initially completed recording their second album After We Go after two extensive recording sessions in late 2003, believing they had delivered a finished product they turned in their final version to their label. However, Maverick Records was not entirely satisfied with it and insisted that the band return to the studio for a third session to record at least three more songs. This final round of recording resulted in more tracks, including the eventual singles \"Hey Now\" and \"The Chain. \"[40] Lead singer Hugo Ferreira later reflected on the difficult process, stating, \"This record was a long and painful process to make. We were under a lot of pressure from our label to spit something out.\" As part of the label's demands, Tantric]was required to include a cover song on the album, though no specific song was suggested. Instead of spending time deliberating, the band decided to make the selection completely random—by tuning in to a classic rockradio station and picking the first song that played. That song happened to be Fleetwood Mac's \"The Chain. \"[41] Guitarist Todd Whitener recalled the gamble in an interview with the Houston Chronicle saying, \"This could be a very bad thing by taking this approach.\" He explained that the band had trouble agreeing on a song where all four members had only positive things to say, so they let fate decide. Fortunately, they all felt that \"The Chain\" could be molded into their sound.[42] The song was recorded by the Canadian rock band Three Days Grace, released from their EP, Lost in You. It was released on 15 March 2011.[48] The song peaked at number 45 on the Rock Digital Song Sales chart.[49]",

A new era, and a new F1 theme, as Channel 4 breaks The Chain Fleetwood Mac’s The Chain will not be Channel 4’s Formula 1 signature theme for the upcoming 2019 season, Motorsport Broadcasting can reveal. The iconic track has been synonymous with Formula 1 coverage on UK television for decades, with the BBC using it as its soundtrack until 1996. Following ITV’s acquisition of Formula 1 rights in 1997, the commercial broadcaster opted to head in a different direction with their soundtrack, using a mix of Jamiroquai, Apollo 440, Bachman Turner Overdrive and Moby during their twelve years of covering the sport. When the BBC returned to the F1 frame from a television perspective in 2009, The Chain duly returned with them. Channel 4 took over the free-to-air baton from the BBC at the end of 2015, and have used the Fleetwood Mac hit since. Heading into the new season however, I understand that Channel 4 and Whisper Films have all but given up hope in securing the famous bass riff for their opening titles. The broadcaster begins a new era of Formula 1 broadcasting in the UK next weekend in Melbourne, with 20 of the 21 races airing in highlights form this season. Sources close to the situation have confirmed that the broadcaster has secured an alternative modern track, which will debut during next Saturday’s coverage of the Australian Grand Prix qualifying session. In a separate development, Sky have confirmed that they will also not be using The Chain in their coverage this season. Responding to questions from fans on social media, Sky said that it was “not feasible to use the [The Chain] on the titles.” I understand that Sky’s desire to use theme, hence its inclusion in their pre-season trailer, has resulted in a bidding war between the two broadcasters and record company Universal Music Publishing Group, which in turn has concluded with neither Channel 4 or Sky securing the rights to The Chain for 2019.",

The Chain Never Lasts Forever For those of us of a certain age, and usually with a UK back-story, Fleetwood Mac and their iconic track The Chain, from the planet moving album Rumours released in February 1977, shall for all time be the F1 theme tune. Three minutes and five seconds into what until then has been mostly a Fleetwood Mac-style medium pace ballad explodes. Firstly, John McVie kicks off one of the most memorable bass lines of the past one hundred years. Some seconds later Lindsey Buckingham kicks in the lead guitar before, about one minute into the break, the rest of the band, including Christine McVie, crank it up for the glorious finale. The Chain was actually made up from a number of different projects members of the band had been working on, including Stevie Nicks and Buckingham before they even joined Fleetwood Mac, and as a result it is one of the few tracks on which all five band members are given song-writing credit. So it was from around 1978 until 1996, that the BBC used this segment of a remarkable tune as the introduction to F1 each race weekend. Now here we are. December 2022, and on 30th November 2022, at the age of 79 Christine McVie shrugged off this mortal coil and joined, one is safe to assume, the choir immortal. While she appeared throughout the The Chain she was not directly involved in the segment of it used by F1, yet it was still her track. Keyboards, backing vocals, artistic input. What merit a life? George Harrison slept at the McLaren factory while his McLaren F1 road car, the original designed by Gordon Murray, and powered by a naturally aspirated BMW engine, was being built. Focus and passion know only one way to move forward. Mick Schumacher is named after Mick Doohan, a good friend to Michael.

That's because “The Chain” was used by the BBC for many years as the ... Chain” and Formula 1 have been paired in the average Brit’s mind over the years. A mental connection that’s even outlived the use of the tune as the theme for a TV programme about motor racing. Even on a non-BBC radio station the other day, I heard the DJ use “The Chain” as the bed for a conversation about motor racing. Yep, there’s nothing that instantly signals “motor racing” to the average Brit like hearing John McVie play those iconic bass notes from “The Chain”… In case you’re wondering, the BBC’s motor racing coverage used the segment often described as the guitar solo from “The Chain”. It’s probably more accurate to describe it as the outro…if it was a piece of classical music, you might even describe that section as the Final Movement, because it’s quite a departure from the vocals which have gone before. John McVie’s bass line marks the end of the tortured lyrics about personal relationships imploding and launches us into a free-spirited musical exploration of what it might feel like to experience complete relief after someone’s stopped pushing your heart through a shredder. It’s ironic, and tragic, that Fleetwood Mac’s finest, and most commercially successful, creative work came at the time when the band, collectively and individually, were in melt-down. “The Chain” opened the second side of Fleetwood Mac’s “Rumours” album. That 1977 album remains one of the best-selling albums in music history, with in excess of 40 million copies sold since its release. And it’s an odd song in many ways. Unusually, for a Fleetwood Mac song, the songwriting is credited to the entire band. Most Fleetwood Mac songs you can hum along with were written by just one or two band members. That seems only fair, mind you, as “The Chain” was essentially spliced together in the studio from a number of bits and pieces each of the band members had written separately.",

The song has become synonymous with the sport on the BBC since it was first adopted by the corporation in 1978. Channel 4 tweeted on Friday: ‘F1 has a new home but some things just have to remain: we’re chuffed to announce that The Chain by Fleetwood Mac will be our title music.’ Former McLaren driver David Coulthard has already made the switch from the BBC to Channel 4, but Suzi Perry, the presenter of the BBC’s F1 coverage following the departure of Jake Humphrey to BT Sport in 2013, last week ruled out joining him. Channel 4 will show 10 races live – without commercial breaks – and screen extensive highlights of the remaining 11 races scheduled for the upcoming season which gets under way in Melbourne on March 20. THE CHAIN ‘The Chain’ was the seventh track on Fleetwood Mac’s February 1977 album ‘Rumours’ having been created the previous year. It was created by combining segments from previously rejected songs and therefore is the only song on the album to be credited to all five band members of the time – Lindsey Buckingham, Mick Fleetwood, Christine McVie, John McVie and Stevie Nicks.

The song has become synonymous with the sport on the BBC since it was first adopted by the corporation in 1978. Channel 4 tweeted on Friday: 'F1 has a new home but some things just have to remain: we're chuffed to announce that The Chain by Fleetwood Mac will be our title music.' Fleetwood Mac recorded 'The Chain' back in 1976 and the song has become synonymous with Formula One. Pictured left to right: Mick Fleetwood, Stevie Nicks, John McVie, Christine McVie and Linsey Buckingham 'The Chain' was only an album track but gained popularity through its association with the sport of F1 'The Chain' was the seventh track on Fleetwood Mac's iconic 1977 album 'Rumours' Former McLaren driver David Coulthard has already made the switch from the BBC to Channel 4, but Suzi Perry, the presenter of the BBC's F1 coverage following the departure of Jake Humphrey to BT Sport in 2013, last week ruled out joining him. Channel 4 will show 10 races live - without commercial breaks - and screen extensive highlights of the remaining 11 races scheduled for the upcoming season which gets under way in Melbourne on March 20. THE CHAIN 'The Chain' was the seventh track on Fleetwood Mac's February 1977 album 'Rumours' having been created the previous year. It was created by combining segments from previously rejected songs and therefore is the only song on the album to be credited to all five band members of the time - Lindsey Buckingham, Mick Fleetwood, Christine McVie, John McVie and Stevie Nicks. The bass section at the end of 'The Chain' was created by Fleetwood and John McVie, then combined with lyrics written separately by Nicks. She and Christine McVie then reworked the first part of the song.",

Here’s how it works. (Image credit: Michael Ochs Archives) “I think anyone who creates will tell you that it’s very difficult to work completely linearly to get what you’re after,” Lindsey Buckingham has said of The Chain. The only song credited to all five members of Fleetwood Mac’s 1977 line-up, The Chain was assembled with disparate links and spare parts and a lot of arranging ingenuity. Recorded during a period of romantic break-ups and high tension within the band, it has come to represent the remarkable endurance of one of rock’s most volatile bands. It began in 1976, during the sessions for the Rumours album. Christine McVie brought in a song-in-progress called Butter Cookie (Keep Me There). On the Super Deluxe Edition of that now classic album, you can hear the song evolve through early demos and instrumentals. A feathery, Van Morrison-like groove gives way to a swampier chug, as the band search for the right feel and Christine McVie experiments with words. But it never quite rises above what might have become a solid album track. Then in the last minute it suddenly roars to life, powered by the entrance of John McVie’s memorable low-end bass riff. Drummer Mick Fleetwood called that thematic riff “a major contribution” He said: “The Chain basically came out of a jam. It was put together, as distinct from someone literally sitting down and writing a song. It was very much collectively a band composition.” As producer, Buckingham cited two inspirations for the process of assembling the song. Brian Wilson and his classic Beach Boys track Good Vibrations was an obvious comparison. The other one was more surprising.",

Murray Walker was pleased to hear ... And this list features some iconic tunes during the sport’s golden years. One of the first on the block was “The Chain” by Fleetwood Mac, used by the BBC between 1978 and 1997. Murray Walker was pleased to hear that, for the 2009 season, the BBC would re-use the tube as opening titles for races. At the time, he admitted to The Telegraph: \"Every time I hear that music, I get butterflies. Because I know that when it stops, I start.\" In 2016, Channel 4 obtained the rights for Formula One broadcast in the UK, and continued to play “The Chain” each Sunday before a GP start. Between 2006 and 2008, ITV 1 used the electric rock song ‘Lift Me Up’by Moby, for its F1 coverage in the UK. The original composition was remixed with F1 sounds to make it faster, and more vibrant. We can feel the nostalgia of some fans in the clip’s comments on YouTube: “This song marked one of the best periods of F1, so many memories…”. Another song which left its mark in the sport is ‘Just Drive’, by Alistair Griffin. Indeed, BBC1 used it at the end of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2010, illustrating the season’s highlights. It was the song's premiere too, and immediately climbed up the charts! One listen to this song and you will know why it was so high up the charts in no time! After its purchase by the American group Liberty Media in 2017, Formula One entered a whole new digital era. And only a year later, in 2018, Brian Tyler was commissioned to produce the very first “Official F1 Theme”, played as the opening titles for each Grand Prix. And the Hollywood composer certainly did it brilliantly. His “F1 Theme” is known by every ardent fan, and followers of the sport, who get goosebumps when listening to the masterpiece. You must have understood some famous tunes within Formula One, then.",

The Spanish occupation by the Moors began in 711 AD when an African army, under their leader Tariq ibn-Ziyad, crossed the Strait of Gibraltar from northern Africa and invaded the Iberian peninsula ‘Andalus’ (Spain under the Visigoths). 2. A European scholar sympathetic to the Spaniards remembered the conquest in this way: a. [T]he reins of their (Moors) horses were as fire, their faces black as pitch, their eyes shone like burning candles, their horses were swift as leopards and the riders fiercer than a wolf in a sheepfold at night . . . The noble Goths [the German rulers of Spain to whom Roderick belonged] were broken in an hour, quicker than tongue can tell. Oh luckless Spain! [i] 3. The Moors, who ruled Spain for 800 years, introduced new scientific techniques to Europe, such as an astrolabe, a device for measuring the position of the stars and planets. Scientific progress in Astronomy, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Geography and Philosophy flourished in Moorish Spain 4. Basil Davidson, one of the most noted historians recognized and declared that there were no lands at that time (the eighth century) “more admired by its neighbours, or more comfortable to live in, than a rich African civilization which took shape in Spain” 5. At its height, Córdova, the heart of Moorish territory in Spain, was the most modern city in Europe. The streets were well-paved, with raised sidewalks for pedestrians. During the night, ten miles of streets were well illuminated by lamps. (This was hundreds of years before there was a paved street in Paris or a street lamp in London.) Cordova had 900 public baths – we are told that a poor Moor would go without bread rather than soap! 6. The Great Mosque of Córdoba (La Mezquita) is still one of the architectural wonders of the world in spite of later Spanish disfigurements.",

Known in Arabic as al-Andalus, the ... Advertisement In Portuguese schools, the five centuries of Muslim rule are studied only briefly. Textbooks place more emphasis on a triumphant “reconquest” of the territory by Christian rulers, aided by crusaders, that ended in the 13th century. Since then, Portuguese identity has been constructed in opposition to the Moors, historically depicted as enemies. But not everyone agrees with this version of history. “A great part of the population converted to Islam,” explains Filomena Barros, a professor of Medieval History at the University of Evora. Research has suggested that by the 10th century, half the population of the Iberian peninsula was Muslim. For Barros, Muslims who sailed from North Africa were no more foreign than the Christian kings and armies from northern Europe who conquered the territory before and after them. “The Iberian Peninsula kept being conquered,” she says. “It’s interesting we don’t talk about the Roman conquest, or the Visigothic conquest, but we always talk about the Islamic conquest.” Before Muslim armies arrived, the region was ruled by Visigoths, a Germanic people who ruled between 418 and 711. Traces of Portugal’s Islamic past can still be found [Marta Vidal/Al Jazeera] History textbooks emphasise the battles fought by Christian rulers against Muslim ones, but the defeat of Muslim armies did not mean an end to the Muslim presence in Portugal. “The Christian reconquest doesn’t mean Muslims go back to their land, because this land was theirs as well,” says the historian. Today, however, less than 0.5 percent of the population of 11 million is Muslim, and few are aware that Muslims once made up a much larger proportion of the population.

With the dual drive of territorial acquisition and Islamic expansion, the Moors saw the fertile and resource-rich Iberian Peninsula as a lucrative conquest, offering control over key trade routes and the opportunity to spread Islamic culture and knowledge. The Moors weren't all work and no play, though. Their ingenious architects created some of Europe's most awe-inspiring monuments, including the Alhambra in Granada and the Great Mosque of Córdoba. Farewell to the Moors All good things must come to an end, and so it was with the Moors in Andalucia. The fall of Granada in 1492 is not merely a historical footnote, but a monumental event that ended an era and began a new chapter in Spanish history. As the last stronghold of the Moors in Spain, Granada's surrender to the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, brought the nearly 800-year period of Islamic rule in the Iberian Peninsula to a close. The Christian forces, driven by religious zeal and the promise of territorial expansion, methodically wore down the resistance of the Nasrid dynasty ruling Granada. Boabdil, the last Muslim king, was faced with internal strife, dwindling resources, and relentless pressure from the Catholic forces. This significant event concluded a lengthy military campaign and symbolized a turning point in Spanish history. The victory led to the unification of Spain under Catholic rule, setting the stage for the Spanish Inquisition and the Age of Exploration. Granada's legacy, encapsulated in the stunning Alhambra, continues to resonate as a symbol of a complex and rich cultural era. The Moors may have left, but their influence remained. They left behind a rich cultural heritage, and perhaps, a lasting appreciation for the finer things in life. From the zest of the Andalusian music to the flair of its architecture, the Moorish influence continues to resonate. What did the Moors Ever do for Spain? What did the Moors ever do for Spain?",

Item added to your cart Moorish Marvels: A Brief History of the Moors in Portugal Portugal, with its breathtaking landscapes and rich history, has been a melting pot of cultures throughout the centuries. One such influential culture that left an indelible mark on the country is that of the Moors. The Moors, an Islamic civilization, arrived in Portugal in the 8th century and their presence lasted for over four centuries. In this article, I'll delve lightly into the historical background of the Moors in Portugal, explore their cultural contributions, and uncover the lasting legacy they left behind. Historical Background of the Moors in Portugal To understand the impact of the Moors in Portugal, we must first delve into their historical background. The Moors were a Muslim people of Berber and Arab descent who originated from North Africa. They quickly expanded their empire across North Africa and into the Iberian Peninsula, which includes present-day Portugal and Spain. In 711 AD, the Moors crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and established their presence in the region. The Moors settled in different parts of the country, with the Algarve region (from the Arabic: Al-Gharb, meaning 'the West') and the city of Silves being of particular importance. Silves, in its Moorish heyday, was a center of culture, knowledge, and commerce, complete with bustling markets, palatial homes, and flowing fountains. Arrival and Expansion of the Moors in Portugal The arrival of the Moors in Portugal marked the beginning of a new era. They quickly established themselves in various regions, including Lisbon, Santarém, and Mértola. These cities became centers of trade, commerce, and learning under Moorish rule. Their influence was strongest in the Alentejo and Algarve regions of southern Portugal. The Moors brought with them advanced agricultural techniques, scientific knowledge, and architectural marvels that transformed the landscape of Portugal. Influence of the Moors in Portugal The influence of the Moors on Portuguese culture and architecture is undeniable. Moorish Portugal was a hub of intellectual and artistic achievements.",

Carthage fell in 698. In 705 ... Both Mūsā and Ṭāriq were recalled to Syria by the caliph, and they departed in 714 at the end of the summer; by then most of the Iberian Peninsula was under Muslim control. The rapid success of the Islamic forces can be explained by the fact that Hispano-Visigoth society had not yet succeeded in achieving a compact and homogeneousintegration. The Jews, harassed by the legal ordinances of Toledo, were particularly hostile toward the Christian government. Moreover, the Muslim conquest brought advantages to many elements of society: the burden of taxes was generally less onerous than it had been in the last years of the Visigoth epoch; serfs who converted to Islam (mawālī; singular: mawlā) advanced into the category of freedmen and enrolled among the dependents of some conquering noble; and Jews, who were no longer persecuted, were placed on an equal footing with the Hispano-Romans and Goths who still remained within the Christian fold. Thus, in the first half of the 8th century, a new society developed in Muslim Spain. The Arabs were the ruling element; a distinction was made between baladiyyūn (i.e., Arabs who had entered Spain in 712 under Mūsā) and Syrians (who arrived in 740 under Balj ibn Bishr). Below them in status were the Imazighen, who made up the majority of the invading troops, whose numbers and influence continued to grow over the course of centuries because of their steady influx from Africa. Then came the native population who had converted to Islam, the musālimah, and their descendants, the muwallads; many of them were also mawālī (i.e., connected by patronage with an Arab) or even themselves of Amazigh lineage. This group formed the majority of the population because during the first three centuries social and economic motives induced a considerable number of natives to convert to Islam. Christians and Jews who kept their religion came next in the social hierarchy, but their numbers decreased in the course of time.",

Holy Roman Emperor Charles V imposed the same religious requirement on Moors in the Kingdom of Aragon in 1526, forcing its Muslim population to convert during the Revolt of the Germanies.[124] Spanish Inquisition Making things more complex were the many former Muslims and Jews known as Moriscos, Marranos, and Conversos, who shared ancestors in common with many Christians, especially among the aristocracy, causing much concern over loyalty and attempts by the aristocracy to hide their non-Christian ancestry.

The Granadine Moors were forced to pay to Castile a sizable annual tribute, but Moorish culture experienced something of a rebirth in Christian Spain. In Toledo, a Castilian city already famous throughout Europe as a crossroads of Christian, Arab, and Jewish thought, Alfonso X established the Escuela de Traductores (School of Translators), an institution that made Arabic works available to the Christian West. During the same period, James I of Aragon completed Aragon’s part in the Reconquest. After occupying the Balearics (1235), he captured Valencia (1238). Unlike Ferdinand, James carefully worked to preserve the agricultural economy of the Moors and so established the final peninsular frontiers of Aragon. In Portugal, Afonso III captured Faro (1249), the last Moorish stronghold in the Algarve. By the end of the 13th century, the Reconquest was, for all practical purposes, brought to an end.

I think the best time to go is in May, when you can enjoy the Festival of the Courtyards and the gardens in bloom, but September and October also bring more comfortable weather, clear skies and fewer crowds. Andalusia’s Moorish history The Moorish-built Torre del Oro (Golden Tower), Seville In 711 AD, North African Muslims invaded Andalusia, ushering in seven centuries of Muslim rule on the Iberian Peninsula. We say ‘the Moors’, but that’s an imprecise term that lumps together disparate factions from North Africa, including the Umayyads, Almohads and Nasrids. These rulers brought with them a sophisticated culture that prized tolerance and scientific learning, something of a contrast to the rest of Europe during the Middle Ages. Scholars and engineers flourished across the peninsula, especially in Al-Andalus, as the southern region was known. Here, Muslims, Christians and Jews all lived and worked side by side. Almost immediately after the Moorish armies invaded, Christian forces tried to drive them out — a long, uneven process called the Reconquista.",

          "snippet": "Why Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man Has Organic Web Shooters So Controversial The idea of giving Spider-Man organic web-shooters on film originated in James Cameron’s Spider-Man movie concept, which perhaps excessively used them as a metaphor for puberty. Comic fans in the early 2000s were not pleased with such a significant change from the source material and Cameron’s crude ideas. One fan was quoted as expressing disinterest in an additional mutation further alienating Peter Parker from his peers when his awkward demeanor already did that sufficiently enough. There was at least one website created that was dedicated to preventing the Spider-Man film from using the idea. Ultimately, the organic-web shooters were handled tastefully by Raimi, who used the concept to support his goal of emphasizing the natural evolution of Peter Parker. The Organic Webbing Is Tobey Maguire Spider-Man's USP Following Spider-Man: No Way Home, there are now three on-screen Spider-Men in Marvel's ever-growing cinematic multiverse. While there are no concrete plans to bring back Maguire's Spider-Man for another crossover or a possible Spider-Man 4, it's very possible given the financial success of No Way Home and Marvel's ongoing interest in multiverse stories. In this new multiverse, Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man having organic web shooters makes him distinct from other iterations of the character. Maguire's Peter Parker's organic powers are a sign of how he is portrayed as more of an ordinary, emotional young adult instead of a scientific whiz kid. Raimi's Spider-man movies provided the MCU a template for relatable superheroes, but the success of the latter also accustomed audiences to more complex plots of the type found in long-running comic books. Whereas Raimi gave Peter Parker organic web-shooters in par to streamline the Spider-Man mythology, this was no longer necessary by the time Garfield and Holland's versions came along.",

Organic webs would have required Peter to suddenly start eating a huge amount more than his previous diet in order to keep up with it. Ironically, the Andrew Garfield version of Peter Parker started eating a lot more, and the Tobey Maguire version did not. 2 Answers 2 First of all Spider-Man doesn't have Organic webs in its starting stage in comics. He got Organic web later in the Comics series. In the Sam Raimi's trilogy of Spider-Man he does not follow the real Spider-Man comics story as it is and skipped the Artificial Web-shooters thing and even skipped the main characters like Gwen Stacy. So, you can say that it's the director's/writer's choice to choose which aspects they grasp from the original content or not. Here is some description of his main powers from origin to now in main universe of Marvel Comics - Original abilities When Peter Parker was bitten by a lethally irradiated spider, radioactive mutagenic enzymes in the spider's venom quickly caused numerous body-wide changes. Immediately after the bite, he was granted his original powers: primarily superhuman strength, reflexes, and balance; the ability to cling tenaciously to most surfaces; and a subconscious precognitive sense of danger, which he called a \"",

          "snippet": "marvel - Does Spider-Man's webbing dissolve in Raimi's Spider ... @Astralbee This was main comic continuity to the main movie universe at the time and the move to organic was because of the movies. Of course it doesn't have to relate and I say as such in my answer. However, as they are the only two universes with organic webs it makes sense there would be some relation. I'll start this with pointing out a difference between the semantics of \"web\" and \"cobweb\". The difference implies that a \"web\" is maintained, and a \"cobweb\" is abandoned. Comparing the two, you can notice a difference in both strength and stickiness. I personally have experienced webs that were surprisingly resilient to being broken - similar to plucking a leaf from a tree almost. Whereas entire cobwebs can be brushed away by hand. Additionally, while a cobweb might \"stick\" to you when you walk through one, you can simply brush it off, whereas with a web, you do need to actually pull it off. The adhesiveness is caused by fluid coating the web in places, which would \"dry up\" over time and lose its adhesiveness. Now, in the comic series, Spider-Man is mostly known for his mechanical web shooter, and his special formula for its rapid disintegration. However, after constantly having to deal with running out of ammo, Peter does actually develop organic shooters. Since this was actually developed after the initial creation of the mechanical web shooters, it likely follows a similar design, i.e. the quick disintegration style. However, in the movies, Peter starts with this power. There is very little talk about this, other than the constant debate about whether or not it was a good idea, so there is little else other than assumption that can be mode here. However, it can be explained with several assumptions: It acts exactly the same way as normal spider webs. After a time, it simply disintegrates on its own. Out in the streets of New York, the wind, rain, and general weather would likely take its toll on the web.",

Is it Bruce Wayne, Gotham's billionaire playboy? Could it be Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for the Daily Planet? Or maybe it's Dr. Bruce Banner, a scientist hiding a green-eyed secret. Something tells us Peter Parker, a student at Midtown High School, doesn't exactly sound like a dashing alter-ego for a swinging superhero. That being said, Stan Lee wanted Peter to be a relatable character, but also show off more of an intellect than money or reputation. That's also why he had him design the web-shooters himself, to show the readers a superhero with a skilled mind and intellect. After all, aren't brains a bit better than brawn alone? 18 ALL IN THE WRIST Where the comic books and later adaptations had Spider-Man's web-shooters be a device or some form of experimental weaponry. In the 2002 film, however, Sam Rami had a different idea in mind for his spidery spinnerets. Let's just say the Spider-Suit wasn't the only thing skin tight. Unlike most interpretations, Sam Rami's Spider-Man had organic web glands in his wrists, cutting out the web-shooters entirely. True, this version made Peter more spider-like in concept, but we can't help feel there's a certain something missing from our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

The stadium, which opened in 2017, is still one ... The NFL's biggest event of each year is the Super Bowl, and it does not let any run-of-the-mill stadium hold it. Stadiums must meet a very specific set of criteria, including that they're able to seat no fewer than 70,000 people, have either a roof or gameday temperature of more than 50 degrees, and have space for pregame entertainment. There must be enough hotels surrounding the hosting area to seat roughly 35 percent of the stadium capacity. Super Bowl 58 was hosted in Las Vegas' Allegiant Stadium, home of the Las Vegas Raiders. Where will the next several Super Bowls be hosted? Here's a look. Super Bowl 2025: New Orleans Few stadiums have seen as many prestigious events as the Caesars Superdome, formerly known as the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. Super Bowl 59 will mark the first that has been hosted under the name of Caesars Superdome. The domed venue can hold a maximum of 76,468 people for football games and has a turf field. In addition to seven Super Bowls (1978, '81, '86, '90, '97, 2002, '13), other notable events hosted here include the Sugar Bowl, the New Orleans Bowl, and the BCS National Championship four times. Every three years, it hosts College Football Playoff semifinal contests when the Sugar Bowl is among those. Many baseball games, Men's Final Fours, U.S. Women's National Team soccer matches, and major boxing matchups have also taken place there. Super Bowl 2026: Santa Clara, Calif. This will be the third time for the big game in the Bay Area. Levi’s Stadium, which originally opened in Santa Clara in 2014, played host to Super Bowl 50 when the Broncos bested the Panthers. San Francisco also reigned victorious in the long ago Super Bowl 19 at Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto when the 49ers beat the Dolphins following the 1984 season.",

The Super Bowl is the marquee event in American sports, and each year cities across the country engage in a competition to be named the host city for a Super Bowl. Hosting \"The Big Game\" comes with economic benefits as tens of thousands of people flood in for two weeks in February who wouldn't be there otherwise. It also is a mark of prestige for the stadium fortunate enough to host a Super Bowl. It makes for a competitive process. The NFL announces host cities for Super Bowls several years in advance due to the preparation and planning required for a city to hold such an endeavor. Super Bowl LVIII between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers, for example, was held at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. That was announced in 2021. To that end, where will the Super Bowl be in the coming years? Future Super Bowl Locations Here are all the Super Bowl locations that have been announced, stretching to 2028.

          "snippet": "NFL announces Atlanta will host Super Bowl LXII in 2028, marking ... The game will be played in February 2028 and mark the fourth time Atlanta has hosted the Super Bowl, and the second in Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Super Bowl LXII will be broadcast by CBS The NFL announced Tuesday afternoon that Atlanta will host Super Bowl LXII. The game will be played in February 2028 and mark the fourth time Atlanta has hosted the Super Bowl, and the second in Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The announcement took place in Atlanta during the league meetings, and it solidifies the sites of the sport's biggest game for the next four years. Super Bowl LXII will be broadcast by CBS. It will be the 23rd Super Bowl broadcast by CBS, a record among all networks. Atlanta hosted its first Super Bowl in 1994 when the Cowboys beat the Bills in Super Bowl XXVIII. The game returned to the Georgia Dome in 2000 when the Rams beat the Titans. And in 2019, the Patriots beat the Rams in Super Bowl LIII in Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which had opened less than two years earlier. This year's Super Bowl will be held in New Orleans, followed by Super Bowl LX at Levi's Stadium and LXI at SoFi Stadium. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has said he expects Las Vegas, which hosted last year's Super Bowl, to be a regular in the Super Bowl rotation that will include New Orleans, Miami and L.A. New stadiums usually get a crack at a Super Bowl, as well. The Titans will open their new stadium in 2027 and potentially be in line for its first Super Bowl. Jacksonville's stadium could open as early as 2028, and the city would be up for its second Super Bowl -- and first since 2005. Though the league announced the Atlanta Super Bowl to be played on Feb. 13, 2028, that could change over the coming years. If the league moves to an 18-game regular season, it would likely remove one preseason game and add a second bye week. That would make the season one week later and could potentially move the date of the future game. The league has floated the idea of lining up the Super Bowl a day before Presidents Day to make the Super Bowl an ostensible national holiday.",
