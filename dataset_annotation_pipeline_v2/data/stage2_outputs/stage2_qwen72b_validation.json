Stanley Cup History The Stanley Cup, notably the oldest trophy competed for by professional athletes in North America, was donated in 1892 by Sir Frederick Arthur Stanley, Lord Stanley of Preston and son of the Earl of Derby. He purchased the trophy for 10 Guineas ($50.00 at that time) to be presented to \"the championship hockey club of the Dominion of Canada.\" The first team ever awarded the Stanley Cup was the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association in 1893. Since 1910, when the National Hockey Association took possession of the Stanley Cup, the trophy has been symbolic of professional hockey supremacy. Beginning in 1926, only NHL teams have competed for this prized trophy. The Montreal Canadiens have won a record 23 Stanley Cups since the formation of the NHL (they also won in 1916), with Toronto a distant second at 13. The Habs also hold the record for most consecutive championships with five, accomplished between the years 1956 and 1960 inclusive. There have been numerous alterations to the Cup structure. In its infancy, tiered rings were added periodically to the bottom of the bowl. This was followed by long narrow bands in 1927 which were later replaced by uneven bands in 1947. Because the Cup is the only professional sports trophy where the name of every member of the winning team is inscribed, bands are often retired to make room for new champions. Retired bands, along with the original Stanley Cup bowl, are proudly displayed in Lord Stanley's Vault in the Esso Great Hall. Currently the Cup consists of a bowl, three tiered bands, a collar, and five barrel or uniform bands. The trophy stands at 35.25 inches and weighs 34.5 pounds. (complete measurement and inscription breakdown). Each year upon presentation of the trophy to the championship team, a summer of celebration begins, as each of the organization's players and staff enjoy 24 hours with the Cup - a tradition which has no rival in any sport.",

The winner is awarded the Stanley Cup, North America's oldest professional sports trophy. From 1914 onwards, the Stanley Cup championship finals alternated between the East and the West each year, with alternating games played according to NHA and PCHA rules.[11] The Cup trustees agreed to this new arrangement, because after the Allan Cup became the highest prize for amateur hockey teams in Canada, the trustees had become dependent on the top two professional leagues to bolster the prominence of the trophy.[12] After the Portland Rosebuds, an American-based team, joined the PCHA in 1914, the trustees issued a statement that the Cup was no longer for the best team in Canada, but now for the best team in the world.[11] Two years later, the Rosebuds became the first American team to play in the Stanley Cup championship finals.[8] In 1917, the Seattle Metropolitans became the first American team to win the Cup.[13] After that season, the NHA dissolved, and the National Hockey League (NHL) took its place.[11] In 1919, the Spanish influenza epidemic forced the Montreal Canadiens and the Seattle Metropolitans to cancel their series tied at 2–2–1, marking the first time the Stanley Cup was not awarded.[14] The format for the Stanley Cup championship changed in 1922, with the creation of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL). Now three leagues competed for the Cup and this necessitated a semi-final series between two league champions, with the third having a bye directly to the finals.[15]",

Especially because it takes a lot of hard work and planning. On top of this, only about half of all businesses survive five years or longer.1 1. Start with a Great Idea Your first step in learning how to start a business is to identify a problem and solution. This is because successful startups begin from business ideas that fill the needs of a group of customers. But your idea doesn’t always have to be a new one. You can update existing products or services in a way that’s better for the consumer. This can be as simple as: Changing the product’s appearance Adding a new feature Finding a new use for a product that customers already love For instance, Apple started from Steve Jobs’ original idea for a computer and has since created enhanced versions that better fit the market. They’ve also continued to evolve newer products like iPhones and iPads, making them more useful with each update. One example is how they’re adding a keyboard for iPads that’ll make them easier to use like a laptop.2 All these innovations by Apple led to them being worth of over a billion dollars. 2. Make a Business Plan Once you have an idea, you’ll want to start building a business plan that describes your products and services in detail. It should include information on your industry, operations, finances and a market analysis. Writing a business plan is also important for getting financing for your startup. Banks are more likely to give loans to companies that can clearly explain how they’re going to use the money and why they need it. 3. Secure Funding for Your Startup The cost of a startup is different for every business owner. However, no matter what your costs are, you’ll likely need to get startup financing from: Friends and family Angel investors Venture capitalists Bank loans You can also apply for a business credit card. Many companies offer 0% APR promotions, which means you won’t pay interest on your purchases if you pay off the balance before the end of the offer period.",

Your headline should give a basic overview of the idea that can excite the person reading on hearing about the same.

Use the lean startup business plan to validate your ideas before wasting time and resources. Why do you need a small startup business plan? A small startup business plan is one of the most important steps in building a company. Apart from helping you to focus on company goals, it aids in obtaining feedback from potential partners and keeps the team on the same page. The best thing about starting small? You can change course at any time! If you need help developing or tweaking your small startup business plan, use this guide for entrepreneurs to get started. You've built a product and you're ready to take the next step, but what's your plan? First, you need a strategy in place. Do you know how much money it will cost, or where exactly that funding should come from? What about marketing strategies for getting customers in the door? You’ll also need to find ways to retain them afterwards so they keep coming back again and again (and spending more). Obtain external funding If you want to get funding from lenders or investors, you need a startup business plan. Lenders want to make sure they're investing in a company that will last and grow. A well-organized idea shows passion for its purpose and outlines clear goals for helping customers. At the same time, having an exit strategy is also important. Making a plan for when things don’t pan out as desired lets investors understand how much value there can be while giving customers (and yourself) peace of mind. Understand your target market One key piece of your business plan is knowing how to conduct a market analysis. To do this, consider the industry, target market, and competitors. Are there any market trends or competitor factors that can affect your business? Review them closely and get ready to make required changes to your business plan.",

          "snippet": "Business Plan: What It Is, What's Included, and How To Write One Key Takeaways A business plan is a document describing a company's core business activities and how it plans to achieve its goals. Startup companies use business plans to get off the ground and attract outside investors. A business plan can also be used as an internal guide to keep an executive team focused on and working toward short- and long-term objectives. Businesses may create a lengthier traditional business plan or a shorter lean startup business plan. Good business plans should include an executive summary and sections on products and services, marketing strategy and analysis, financial planning, and a budget. Want Funding? You Need a Business Plan Understanding Business Plans A business plan is a fundamental document that any new business should have in place prior to beginning operations. Indeed, banks and venture capital firms often require a viable business plan before considering whether they'll provide capital to new businesses. Operating without a business plan usually is not a good idea. In fact, very few companies are able to last very long without one. There are benefits to creating (and sticking to) a good business plan. These include being able to think through ideas before investing too much money in them and working through potential obstacles to success. A good business plan should outline all the projected costs and possible pitfalls of each decision a company makes. Business plans, even among competitors in the same industry, are rarely identical. However, they can have the same basic elements, such as an executive summary of the business and detailed descriptions of its operations, products and services, and financial projections. A plan also states how the business intends to achieve its goals. While it's a good idea to give as much detail as possible, it's also important that a plan be concise to keep a reader's attention to the end. How to Write a Business Plan A well-considered and well-written business plan can be of enormous value to a company. While there are templates that you can use to write a business plan, try to avoid producing a generic result. The plan should include an overview and, if possible, details of the industry of which the business will be a part. It should explain how the business will distinguish itself from its competitors.",

Amidst this thrill, the business plan concept may seem a little old-fashioned, maybe even unnecessary. But make no mistake, disregarding the power of a robust business plan could be a costly error. In this article, we'll explore why every startup needs a solid business plan serving as its blueprint for success regardless of its nature or size. Business Plan: Your Startup's GPS Essentially, a business plan is a comprehensive document that outlines a business's objectives and lays out the roadmap for achieving those goals. The compass guides your business, a detailed blueprint covering everything from your business overview and market analysis to detailed financial forecasts. A business plan is your startup's GPS, charting the course, helping you track progress, and selling your business proposition to stakeholders like investors and partners. Driving Your Startup: The Multifaceted Role of a Business Plan A business plan plays a critical role in a startup. It sets the strategic direction, defining your mission, vision, and strategies to keep your startup on the right path. It is a vital communication tool, effectively presenting your business proposition to stakeholders - employees, investors, partners, and customers. If you're seeking financial backing, an effective business plan is non-negotiable. Spotlight on Success: How Robust Business Plans Propelled Uber, Airbnb, and Dropbox The success stories of industry behemoths like Uber, Airbnb, and Dropbox all started with small ideas that turned into disruptive forces, thanks in no small part to well-articulated business plans. Uber's clear business plan highlighted how it would upend the traditional taxi industry with its revolutionary app-based service.

If you're trying to raise outside funding from investors, however, you're the exception — that's the case in which a business plan is needed. Over four years ago I left my highly successful (read: stressful) job in investment banking to start my own coaching business where I help future online business owners find the right business idea, get paying clients quickly, and build a business foundation that scales. Eighteen months into the business, I had my first $20,000 month. Since then, the business has earned up to $24,000 a month. Little secret: I didn’t make a business plan, and you probably don’t need to, either. If you are raising capital for a startup, potential investors will need to see a plan — but if you are aiming not to borrow money, a plan may not provide any advantage at all. When I began my business I purposely didn’t start by creating a complex business plan. I knew that in the fast-paced online market I was entering, I would only get a true sense of the numbers once I tested the idea in reality, not on paper. Instead of a traditional plan, I took more of an experimental approach and created what I now call ‘a concept to test.’ A concept to test includes: The idea The value proposition to clients An offer A minimal amount of marketing to test the concept This is just enough to put an idea to market and see if it works. No more, no less. My initial concept was based on a mix of my talent and people’s needs. I realized that people needed help with business ideas; specifically people who wanted to start online businesses. I saw that they were confused and overwhelmed and didn’t know where to begin. I knew that if I could get some time with them, to guide them through my idea generating process, that I would be able to help. I fleshed out this concept by clarifying exactly who my client was, created the messaging that would speak to them (my value proposition) and designed offers that would appeal to their needs.",

When you go to a movie, what do they point out before the feature begins to play? Where the exits are. During your first week of kindergarten, they line up all the kids and teach them fire drills to exit the building. Too many times I have witnessed business leaders that don’t have three or four predetermined exit routes. This has led to lower company value and even destroyed family relationships.” A business plan helps you figure out where your company is going, how it will overcome any potential difficulties, and what you need to sustain it. When you’re ready to put pen to paper, use a free template to help. 3. Assess your finances. Starting any business has a price, so you need to determine how you will cover those costs. Do you have the means to fund your startup, or will you need to borrow money? If you’re planning to leave your current job to focus on your business, do you have savings to support yourself until you make a profit? Find out how much your startup costs will be. Many startups fail because they run out of money before turning a profit. It’s never a bad idea to overestimate the amount of startup capital you need, as it can take time before the business begins to bring in sustainable revenue. Perform a break-even analysis. One way you can determine how much money you need is to perform a break-even analysis. This essential element of financial planning helps business owners determine when their company, product or service will be profitable. Every entrepreneur should use this formula as a tool because it tells you the minimum performance your business must achieve to avoid losing money. Furthermore, it helps you understand exactly where your profits come from, so you can set production goals accordingly. Here are the three most common reasons to conduct a break-even analysis: Ask yourself: How much revenue do I need to generate to cover all my expenses? Which products or services turn a profit, and which ones are sold at a loss? Price a product or service. When most people think about pricing, they consider how much their product costs to create and how competitors are pricing their products.",

It takes a lot of time, dedication and perseverance. The emotional and financial payoffs can be memorable. Every business needs a business plan no matter how large or small it begins. Writing a business plan isn’t a difficult task. To write a good business plan takes a lot of thought and consideration. There are many templates available to help you get started. Think beyond the blank lines to how you can customize your business plan so that you can really make it your own. There are countless things to consider as you prepare to write your business plan that will have a major impact on the final result. If your business plan includes forming a board of directors, it’s wise to factor the cost of a BoardEffect board management software system into your plans to help your business get off the ground based on sound good corporate governance principles. Here are a few things to give you some food for thought before you get started writing your business plan: Key Considerations for Startup Businesses It’s been said that timing is everything, and there’s certainly a lot of truth to that when it comes to deciding the best time to launch your business. Starting a business is incredibly time-consuming in the early months, so it’s wise to consider whether your lifestyle will allow you to dedicate the necessary time to pursuing a successful startup. Think about what is going on in your life and how that may (or may not) change in the next few years. If you’re getting married, having a child or dealing with a debilitating illness, it might not be the best time to launch a startup. Finances play a big role in timing a startup business. Do you have the funds to start a company? Do you have a plan for how to obtain startup funding? Will you be quitting a job that currently pays the bulk of your bills? If you’re ready to go, complete your business plan, make those important decisions and stick by them! Be sure to bear down on your budget. Large chunks of startup money whittle away quickly.",

Here's what to include when writing out the launch plans for your startup. Even the greatest new business ideas could fail to get off the ground without the right launch plan. Any potential investors, venture capitalists, lenders, and potential customers want to know what your new tech business is about and what your goals are. Do startups need a business plan? Generally, no they aren't required, but it can make it easier for investors, lenders, and customers to understand your ideas. It serves as a roadmap to how you’ll succeed, with an in-depth look at your business needs, business opportunities, and how you’ll proceed each step of the way. A good business plan also gives you a chance to focus on all aspects of your business, spot potential problems before they arise, and make sure you’ve thought through your strategy. The right business plan can save you time and money later on. What are the most important elements of a tech startup business plan? The key elements of a business plan identify what products or services you’ll offer, why customers would choose your company, and who your competitors are. It highlights your goals and your strategy for accomplishing them. Of course, there’s more to a successful business plan than the above basic elements. So what should a tech startup business plan include? Here are eight topics to include: 1. Executive summary Think of this as your “elevator pitch.” It’s something that anyone who reads your business plan will focus on, to get an idea of what your business is about. The executive summary should include: A description of your business operations, including its products and services Your target market and potential customers Your top competitors and what sets you apart from them Your company’s goals, both short-term and long-term The background and business history of yourself and your team Financial information, such as your investors and any customers you may have lined up You might also include a mission statement, an identification of key stakeholders, and a SWOT analysis of your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. 2.",

Investors Prefer Pitch Decks Over Business Plans. Our research revealed that the vast majority of investors would rather see a visual and scannable presentation as opposed to a massive business plan as a Word doc. Most no longer consider business plans as necessary fundraising tools. You can simply show your business model in a slide. Here is the a recap of our data: Pitch Deck Only - 70% (19 out of 27) Both Business Plan and Pitch Deck - 26% (7 out of 27) Business Plan Only - 4% (1 out of 27) To summarize, a solid business plan usually leads to a better pitch deck that wins over investors. Why? Writing a full business plan likely means startups have thought through plans at a deeper, more strategic level. On the contrary, deep thinking can most definitely be acquired without writing 100 pages of text. Sometimes, all you need is a napkin and a ballpoint pen and youâve got your go-to-market strategy sorted. The bottom line: every startup needs a pitch deck. Some might need a long business plan (especially during due diligence). But startups that only send a long-winded business plan to investors instead of a pitch deck will likely end up in the unread pile. Get Access To Our Pitch Deck Insights.

          "snippet": "Why the Lean Start-Up Changes Everything In the past few years, a new methodology for launching companies, called “the lean start-up,” has begun to replace the old regimen. Traditionally, a venture’s founders would write a business plan, complete with a five-year forecast, use it to raise money, and then go into “stealth mode” to develop their offerings, all without getting much feedback from the people they intended to sell to. Lean start-ups, in contrast, begin by searching for a business model. They test, revise, and discard hypotheses, continually gathering customer feedback and rapidly iterating on and reengineering their products. This strategy greatly reduces the chances that start-ups will spend a lot of time and money launching products that no one actually will pay for. Blank, a consulting associate professor at Stanford, is one of the architects of the lean start-up movement and has seen this approach help businesses get off the ground quickly and successfully. He believes that if it’s widely adopted, it would reduce the incidence of start-up failure. In combination with other trends, such as open source software and the democratization of venture financing, it could ignite a new, more entrepreneurial economy. There are numerous indicators that the approach is catching on: Business schools and universities are incorporating lean start-up principles into their curricula. Even more interesting, large companies like GE are applying them to internal innovation initiatives. Launching a new enterprise—whether it’s a tech start-up, a small business, or an initiative within a large corporation—has always been a hit-or-miss proposition. According to the decades-old formula, you write a business plan, pitch it to investors, assemble a team, introduce a product, and start selling as hard as you can. And somewhere in this sequence of events, you’ll probably suffer a fatal setback. The odds are not with you: As new research by Harvard Business School’s Shikhar Ghosh shows, 75% of all start-ups fail. A version of this article appeared in the May 2013 issue of Harvard Business Review. HBR’s definitive articles on innovation will help your organization create breakthrough products, business models, and growth.",

Anderson was the first South African man to reach the final since Cliff Drysdale in 1965, and at any major singles final since Kevin Curren at the 1984 Australian Open, as well as the lowest-ranked man to reach the US Open singles final since the ATP rankings began in 1973.[4][5] Anderson was also the tallest major finalist in history, at 6 feet 8 inches.[6]",

Rafael Nadal Wins the U.S. Open and Brings Superstar Quality Back to Men’s Tennis Rafael Nadal Wins the U.S. Open and Brings Superstar Quality Back to Men’s Tennis 4 minute read Rafael Nadal of Spain poses with the U.S. Open championship trophy after he defeated Kevin Anderson of South Africa in the Men's Singles Finals match on on September 10, 2017 in New York City. Abbie Parr—Getty Images Coming into this year’s tennis season, sports writers and commentators were contemplating career obituaries for Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, rather than predicting that they would sweep the season’s Grand Slams. Who could blame them for preparing for the end of Roger and Rafa, whose stocks were slipping? Nadal’s 2016 results were a dour read: loses the first round at the Australian Open; withdraws from the French Open — where he had won nine titles — with a wrist injury before the third round; misses Wimbledon due to a bum wrist; fails to win a medal at the Rio Olympics; fourth round loss at the U.S. Open; ends the season in October (wrist again). He was 30, a pro for over half his life, with a dossier of injuries to show for it. Meanwhile, Federer, was 35. He had one major victory since 2010, and none since 2012. He had knee surgery in 2016, and lost the last five months of the season to rehab. Nadal and Federer won every Grand Slam tournament in 2006, 2007, and 2010. Now, improbable as it is to believe, you can add 2017 to that ledger. Nadal beat South Africa’s Kevin Anderson in straight sets at the U.S. Open final Sunday evening, 6-3, 6-3, 6-4, to cap off his remarkable Grand Slam campaign.",

The family moved to Midland, Texas, where the senior Bush entered the oil exploration business. The son spent formative years there, attended Midland public schools, and formed friendships that stayed with him into the White House. Bush graduated from Yale, received a business degree from Harvard, and then returned to Midland where he too got into the oil business. In Midland he met and married Laura Welch, a teacher and librarian. They had twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, now out of college and pursuing careers. When George W.

John Quincy Adams, elected the sixth president in 1824, was the son of John Adams, the second president. While John Adams had groomed his son to be president, George Bush, the 41st president, insisted he was surprised when the eldest of his six children became interested in politics, became governor of Texas, and then went on to the White House. During the early part of the 2000 campaign for the White House, Bush enjoyed a double-digit lead in the polls over his opponent Vice President Al Gore Jr. But the gap closed as the election approached and though Gore finally won the popular vote by 543,895 votes, victory or loss of the presidency hinged on Florida’s electoral votes. That struggle through recounts and lawsuits worked its way to the Supreme Court. In the end Bush won the electoral count 271 to 266. His new administration was focused on “compassionate conservatism,” which embraced excellence in education, tax relief and volunteerism among faith-based and community organizations. Bush was challenged in his re-election bid in 2004 by Massachusetts Democratic Senator John Kerry. The election was a good contest, but Bush’s contention that the invasion of Iraq had made the world more secure against terrorism won the national political debate. Bush was re-elected with 51 percent to 48 percent.",

In May 1968, two weeks before his graduation from Yale and the expiration of his student draft deferment, Bush applied as a pilot trainee in the Texas Air National Guard, whose members were less likely than regular soldiers to fight in the Vietnam War. Commissioned a second lieutenant in July 1968, he became a certified fighter pilot in June 1970. In the fall of 1970, he applied for admission to the University of Texas law school but was rejected. Although Bush apparently missed at least eight months of duty between May 1972 and May 1973, he was granted an early discharge so that he could start Harvard Business School in the fall of 1973. His spotty military record resurfaced as a campaign issue in both the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections. After receiving an M.B.A. from Harvard in 1975, Bush returned to Midland, where he began working for a Bush family friend, an oil and gas attorney, and later started his own oil and gas firm. He married Laura Welch, a teacher and librarian, in Midland in 1977. After an unsuccessful run for Congress in 1978, Bush devoted himself to building his business. With help from his uncle, who was then raising funds for Bush’s father’s campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, Bush was able to attract numerous prominent investors. The company struggled through the early 1980s until the eventual collapse of oil prices in 1986, when it was purchased by the Harken Energy Corporation. Bush received Harken stock, a job as a consultant to the company, and a seat on the company’s board of directors. In the same year, shortly after his 40th birthday, Bush gave up drinking alcohol.",

Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, members of the Supreme Court and diplomatic corps, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens: Today our nation lost a beloved, graceful, courageous woman who called America to its founding ideals and carried on a noble dream. Tonight we are comforted by the hope of a glad reunion with the husband who was taken so long ago, and we are grateful for the good life of Coretta Scott King. (Applause.) Every time I'm invited to this rostrum, I'm humbled by the privilege, and mindful of the history we've seen together. We have gathered under this Capitol dome in moments of national mourning and national achievement. We have served America through one of the most consequential periods of our history -- and it has been my honor to serve with you. In a system of two parties, two chambers, and two elected branches, there will always be differences and debate. But even tough debates can be conducted in a civil tone, and our differences cannot be allowed to harden into anger. To confront the great issues before us, we must act in a spirit of goodwill and respect for one another -- and I will do my part. Tonight the state of our Union is strong -- and together we will make it stronger. (Applause.) In this decisive year, you and I will make choices that determine both the future and the character of our country. We will choose to act confidently in pursuing the enemies of freedom -- or retreat from our duties in the hope of an easier life. We will choose to build our prosperity by leading the world economy -- or shut ourselves off from trade and opportunity.",

Biography A World Transformed Sworn in as the 41st President of the United States on January 20, 1989, George Herbert Walker Bush helped usher in a new and more hopeful geopolitical era marked by the spread of freedom and free markets. During his historic term in office, the West prevailed in the Cold War; the Soviet Union gave way to a democratic Russia; the Berlin Wall “fell” and Germany was unified within NATO; and President Bush signed two treaties to drastically reduce the threat of nuclear war. After Iraq’s unprovoked invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Mr. Bush forged an unprecedented coalition of disparate nations to uphold international law. His deft handling of this international crisis enabled him to convene the Madrid Peace Conference later in 1991. Throughout his presidency, George Bush worked closely with his international counterparts, including Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, in ways that advanced America’s interests in peace and economic opportunity. \"To Make Kinder the Face of the Nation\" President Bush was the first sitting vice president to ascend to the presidency since 1837, and he was also only the second American president to serve a full term without party control in either chamber of Congress. Nevertheless, President Bush worked with Congress to pass the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Clean Air Act — landmark civil rights and environmental legislation. He also successfully fought for and negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which was later signed into law. The education summit Mr. Bush hosted in 1989 with all 50 U.S. governors at the University of Virginia helped to spur a national reform movement. The 1990 budget agreement he signed codified into law real caps on discretionary spending by Congress while cutting the deficit by historic levels. Points of Light As president, Mr. Bush launched his “Points of Light” initiative to promote volunteerism and community service across America, and during his term in office he named 1,020 Daily Points of Light hailing from all 50 states.

Eden Park. Support across tour dates Recent tour reviews I had always heard Coldplay were a fantastic band to see live. They did not disappoint last night at Fedex Field, right in the midst of their joyous and decidedly over-the-top Head Full of Dreams tour. The show began with an explosion of color and light (including the LED wristbands supplied to every concertgoer) in the titular track on the band's touring album. Then came fan-favorite \"Yellow,\" followed by \"Every Teardrop is a Waterfall,\" the ever-popular \"The Scientist,\" and \"Birds\" (the latter was a bit of a personal disappointment as it replaced the brilliant \"God Put a Smile Upon Your Face\" from recent setlists). This part of the show finished with the anthem \"Paradise,\" featuring an incredible remix outro. Next the show slowed down for an intimate trio of songs (most of us actually took a seat). This included one of the better tracks from the sub-par \"Ghost Stories\", \"Magic.\" Soon, however, things picked up with the timeless piano strokes of \"Clocks,\" themed to a magical red light show. Next came the lighthearted \"Charlie Brown.\" Before it began, lead singer Chris Martin asked everyone to put away their phones and simply enjoy the show. This was followed by the radio hit \"Hymn for the Weekend,\" a candlelit (okay... Iphone flashlight lit) \"Fix You,\" and \"Viva la Vida.\" This last one was remarkable, as nearly the entire stadium knew the lyrics and sang along to the triumphant \"Oh-oh-ohhhh\" chant. The groovy \"Adventure of a Lifetime\" finished off this section, featuring Chris gettin' down with the audience, asking everyone to \"Get low! \" Then came the highlight of the night for me: an acoustic quad of older (*cough* better *cough*) Coldplay songs which were as intimate as they were nostalgic. The lovely riffs of \"In my Place\" started off the set. \"Don't Panic\" was sung by drummer Will Champion; it's one of my favorites.",

Coldplay is heading back to North America for more of the Music of the Spheres World Tour after its six-night gig in Seoul in April. After the release of its 10th studio album, “Moon Music,” last week, the English band has added 10 North American shows, scheduled for next spring and summer, to the long-running tour. The tour, which kicked off in March 2022, will come to California on May 31 when the “Yellow” and “Something Just Like This” performers play Stanford Stadium in Northern California. Advertisement From there, frontman Chris Martin and the group head to Las Vegas; Denver; El Paso, Texas; and two nights in Toronto — where Coldplay will be among the first acts to play Rogers Stadium, an outdoor concert venue that opens in Ontario next year. The band also set shows in Foxborough, Mass.; Madison, Wis.; and Nashville. They’re set to close out the North American leg on July 26 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. Coldplay’s Chris Martin tells his bandmates to ‘stop, stop, stop, stop, stop’ after a man tries to rush the concert stage in Greece wrapped in an Israeli flag. June 14, 2024 “The dates announced will see the band bring its acclaimed live experience to fans in new cities, continuing to make good on their efforts to reach every corner of the globe,” concert promoter Live Nation said in a statement. Artist presale sign-ups are underway and run through Thursday, with the presale beginning Friday at 9 a.m. local time on Ticketmaster. The general on-sale begins Friday at 12 p.m. local time. Advertisement The seven-time Grammy winners will again release a limited number of Infinity tickets — accessible and affordable tickets that are sold in pairs for $20 apiece — that are sprinkled throughout each venue. Those go on sale Nov. 22. On Tuesday, the band plugged its new album and tour with a performance on NBC’s “Today” show in New York.",
