Acting in this capacity, the President finds themselves ultimately responsible for the safety and security of the United States and its citizens. In this module, you can explore some of the conflicts that arose during President Clinton’s administration and the ways in which the President used military force to ensure the safety of the United States and its allies. Ethnic Cleansing in Bosnia In February 1992, the largely Muslim nation of Bosnia declared its independence from the ailing remnants of Yugoslavia. Two months later, Serbia, the most powerful of the former Yugoslav Republics, invaded Bosnia with the goal of annexing large swathes of the country for the creation of a “greater Serbia.” After making substantial gains, the Serbian Army settled into a system of ethnic cleansing, seeking to purge their occupied lands of all Bosnian Muslims. Click on the memo above to read an intelligence report detailing Serbia's war aims in Bosnia. Early on in the conflict, President Clinton followed the events while supporting peace talks spearheaded by the United Nations and European Commission. However, as the above intelligence report on Serbian War aims shows, Serbia was not likely to abide by the terms and had continued its campaign of ethnic cleansing while talks were held. For President Clinton, it was clear that the security of the Bosnian people, and perhaps the greater stability of the Balkans, hung in the balance. Click the document above to read a still partially classified report on ethnic cleansing in Bosnia.

Some scholars believe the Commander in Chief Clause confers expansive powers on the President, but others argue that even if that is the case, the Constitution does not define precisely the extent of those powers. These scholars tend to construe the Clause narrowly, asserting that the Founders gave the President the title to preserve civilian supremacy over the military, not to provide additional powers outside of a Congressional authorization or declaration of war. After the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon Administrations spent nearly a decade committing U.S. troops to Southeast Asia without Congressional approval, in 1973 Congress responded by passing the War Powers Resolution . The Resolution sought to halt the erosion of Congress's ability to participate in war-making decisions, an aim furthered by the Resolution's requirement that the President communicate to Congress the commitment of troops within 48 hours. Further, the statute requires the President to remove all troops after 60 days if Congress has not granted an extension. Presidents have typically considered the War Powers Resolution to be unconstitutional, and so they have tended not to follow it. This unwillingness has never been challenged by another actor (congress, civilians, etc), so the Supreme Court has never decided on the issue. (This is because the legislative branch is reactionary, meaning the Supreme Court could not get involved unless a suit is brought and makes its way up to the court). In one way, the resolution takes an unprecedented action by allowing the President to unilaterally put American troops into conflict.", "timestamp": "2015-03-09"}, {"doc_id": "d9", "source_url": "https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S2-C1-1-11/ALDE_00013473/", "snippet": "ArtII.S2.C1.1.11 Presidential Power and Commander in Chief Clause Under the Constitution, the President, in addition to being Chief Executive, is Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy.

At the end of a DNA strand is a microscopic bundle of non-crucial DNA, so that none of the important stuff gets snipped off when the cell divides.

According to a researcher at the University of Georgia, we are “not even close” to reaching the maximum potential lifespan.

Today, humans live to be around 80 years-old. Improved nutrition, clean water, better sanitation, and the application of medical science have been key to prolonging life. Experts suspect genetic manipulation, calorie restriction, and new medicines may extend life even further. The team in the study combined reasoning and probability – known as Bayesian theory – to work out potential maximum longevity. Results showed mortality limits have only been postponed in recent years due to records being slow to increase. “As these cohorts attain advanced ages in coming decades, longevity records may therefore increase significantly. Our results confirm prior work suggesting that if there is a maximum limit to the human lifespan, we are not yet approaching it.” (Credit: Anna Shvets from Pexels) So, how long can people really live? Two years ago, another study found life expectancy has the capacity to almost double, going beyond 150. Those findings were based on blood samples from thousands of British and American participants. “Whether or not there is a limit to the human lifespan has been a subject of debate for millennia,” Dr. McCarthy continues. “Historical estimates of the maximum possible lifespan strongly suggest it has increased substantially over recorded history.” The Bible famously records the Hebrews as regarding 80 years as the maximum length of a human life. Around 1,000 years later, the ancient Romans set their official estimate at 100 or 110.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d5", "source_url": "https://guardian.ng/features/why-humans-cannot-live-beyond-150-years-by-study/", "snippet": "Why humans cannot live beyond 150 years, by study | The Guardian ... Why humans cannot live beyond 150 years, by study Scientists have provided explanations on why humans are never going to be able to live beyond 150 years of age.

They developed an app to predict the maximum lifespan. The study was published in the journal Nature Communications. Experts in biology and biophysics fed an artificial intelligence system vast amounts of Deoxy ribonucleic Acid (DNA)/genetic material and medical data, on hundreds of thousands of volunteers in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US). This allowed them to develop an AI-driven iPhone app that, with simple input from a user, can accurately estimate the rate of biological ageing and maximum lifespan. As part of the big data study, they found there were two key parameters responsible for human lifespan, both covering lifestyle factors and how the body responds. The first factor is biological age, linked to stress, lifestyle and disease, and the second is resilience, reflecting how quickly the first factor returns to normal. This allowed the team to determine that the longest any human is likely to ever live is 150 years; almost double the current UK average lifespan of 81 years. The discovery is based on blood samples from two different longitudinal DNA studies, analysed by the team from Gero, a Singapore-based biotech company and Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, New York. When do human brains become “old”? The human brain becomes ‘old’ at just 25, research suggested in February 2017. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is found in the brain and spinal cord, changes its speed of movement in people older than their mid-20s, a Lancaster University study found. These movements are linked to breathing and heart rates, with CSF changes previously being associated with conditions such as multiple sclerosis and high blood pressure.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d6", "source_url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/10/humans-wont-ever-live-far-beyond-115-years/502967/", "snippet": "Humans Won't Ever Live Far Beyond 115 Years - The Atlantic 108 years in the 1990s. “Demographers said that if there’s an end in sight, they couldn’t see it,” says Vijg, who led the new study. “When Calment died at 122, everyone said it’ll only be a matter of time before we have someone who’s 125 or 130. But after Calment, there was no one else. It was 115 … 115 … 115.” To see if that perceived plateau was real, Dong, Milholland, and Vijg turned to two international databaseson longevity and worked out the oldest individuals who died in any given year. They specifically looked at France, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the U.S.—the four countries with the most supercentenarians, people who live to 110 years or more. The data were clear. Between the 1970s and early 1990s, our maximum age rose from around 110 to 115—and then stopped after 1995, shortly before Jeanne Calment died. In fact, Vijg’s team calculated that in any given year, the odds that at least one person in the world will live past their 125th birthday are less than 1 in 10,000. Despite sanitation, antibiotics, vaccines, and other medical advances, the oldest living people simply aren’t dying any later. They’re unlikely to either, regardless of calorie restriction, drugs like rapamycin, and all of our other efforts to slow the flow of sand through the hourglass. “In science, you never know,” says Vijg. “But I’ve not seen anything that I think would break through the ceiling.” The ceiling is probably hardwired into our biology. As we grow older, we slowly accumulate damage to our DNA and other molecules, which turns the intricate machinery of our cells into a creaky, dysfunctional mess. In most cases, that decline leads to diseases of old age, like cancer, heart disease, or Alzheimer’s.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d7", "source_url": "https://www.cnet.com/science/humans-probably-cant-live-past-150-years-research-finds/", "snippet": "Humans probably can't live longer than 150 years, new research ... Science is once again casting doubt on the idea that we could live to be nearly as old as the biblical Methuselah or Mel Brooks' famous 2,000-year-old man. New research from Singapore-base biotech company Gero looks at how well the human body bounces back from disease, accidents or just about anything else that puts stress on its systems. This basic resilience declines as people age, with an 80-year-old requiring three times as long to recover from stresses as a 40-year-old on average. This should make sense if you've ever known an elderly person who has taken a nasty fall. Recovery from such a spill can be lif- threatening for a particularly frail person, whereas a similar fall might put a person half as old out of commission for just a short time and teenagers might simply dust themselves off and keep going. Extrapolate this decline further, and human body resilience is completely gone at some age between 120 and 150, according to new analysis performed by the researchers. In other words, at some point your body loses all ability to recover from pretty much any potential stressor. The researchers arrived at this conclusion by looking at health data for large groups from the US, the UK and Russia. They looked at blood cell counts as well as step counts recorded by wearables. As people experienced different stressors, fluctuations in blood cell and step counts showed that recovery time grew longer as individuals grew older. The new research contains a certain amount of validation for the idea that humans start dying from the moment we're born, but the process seems to speed up significantly somewhere in the mid-thirties to mid-forties when the body's resilience starts to decline more steeply. The study's conclusion that the body loses all ability to cope -- or at least to recover -- from stress before age 150 is line with the conclusions of similar studies, including one from last year that pegged the maximum possible human age at 138 years.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d8", "source_url": "https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a37144873/human-life-expectancy-limit-150-years/", "snippet": "Humans Could Live to Be 150, Science Says Humans Could Live to Be 150, Science Says The main factor limiting our lifespan is a loss of the ability to bounce back after a setback, called \"physiological resilience. \" Even without major health issues, like cancer, your body will eventually run out of energy to help recover from even minor challenges. Even if you somehow manage to make it through decades of old age without a single major health issue—evading cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and so on—scientists say there's a ceiling on how long you can extend your life, throwing cold water on the ambitious Silicon Valley goal to outsmart death. But the thing that's keeping the human body from reaching immortality is surprisingly mundane: over time, your body loses the \"physiological resilience,\" or the ability to bounce back, that you once had in your younger years. That, scientists say in a study published earlier this year in Nature Communications, is enough to limit our lives to 120 to 150 years at the most. Lead researcher Timothy Pyrkov is part of a Singapore-based biotech company called Gero (yes, the name itself is the prefix meaning \"old age\"). Gero's stated goal is \"hacking complex diseases and aging,\" setting a clear agenda for the research. For this longitudinal analysis, Gero collaborated with Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, New York and studied large groups of people in the U.S., U.K., and Russia.

But, the lines are not that clear. Life expectancy and lifespan are two different factors of human well-being that measure longevity. Lifespan refers to the maximum number of years an individual can live, making lifespan unique to everyone. The longest recorded lifespan was Jeanne Calment who lived for 122 years and 5 months, making the maximum possible human lifespan 122 years and 5 months – that is, until someone outlives Calment. Life expectancy, on the other hand, refers to the average age an individual can expect to live at different stages of life. As humans age, physical and cognitive challenges can emerge, making life expectancy a dynamic measurement that changes based on different experiences and lifestyles of an individual. This does not mean that 48 years-old was considered “old” in say, the 1850s. But 48 was the average age that individuals could expect to live to during that time. It turns out that infant mortality rates sharply drive down the average life expectancy in a population (i.e., the number of child deaths in certain regions is so high that there are more childhood deaths than adult deaths, lowering life expectancy for that region). You might think that, since our ability to safely manage childbirth and provide childcare has vastly improved since the 19th century, then children would have a greater chance of surviving into adolescence and even older adulthood. While yes, this is true, and yes, it has certainly contributed to an increase in the human lifespan, humans have been living well into their 70s and 80s since ancient times. For instance, a first century writer, Pliny, dedicated a chapter of The Natural History to individuals who had lived the longest during that time. In the first century, three individuals had already lived to be 100.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d10", "source_url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10946839/Anti-ageing-living-youre-200-really-isnt-pipe-dream.html", "snippet": "Anti-ageing: Why living until you're 200 really isn't a pipe dream ... The idea of living for hundreds of years was once thought to be the pipe dream of billionaires and tech moguls. But scientists at the forefront of anti-ageing research believe they are on the cusp of developing a pill that could lead to people living to the age of 200 and beyond. Medical advances in the last century have led to humans in wealthy nations living into their 80s, almost double the average life expectancy at the turn of the 20th century. Improved nutrition, clean water, better sanitation and huge leaps in medicine have been key in prolonging human life. The oldest known person — the Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who sold canvases to Vincent Van Gogh when she was a girl in the late 1800s — lived to the age of 122, dying in 1997. There is some debate about whether humans can naturally live much beyond that age, but it is hoped that science will take human lifespans beyond what is currently thought possible. Dr Andrew Steele, a British computational biologist and author of a new book on longevity, told MailOnline there is no biological reason humans can't reach the age of 200. He believes the big breakthrough will come in the form of drugs that remove 'zombie cells' in the body, which are thought to be one of the main culprits of tissue and organ decay as we age. Pills that flush these cells out of the body are already in human trials in and could be on the market in as little as 10 years, according to Dr Steele, who believes someone reading this could make it to 150 with the help of the drugs. Another field in particular that piques the interest of anti-ageing scientists is the study of DNA of reptiles and other cold-blooded animals. Michigan State University experts have begun studying dozens different types of long-living reptiles and amphibians — including crocodiles, salamanders and turtles that can live as long as 120 years.
