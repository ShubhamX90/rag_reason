Acting in this capacity, the President finds themselves ultimately responsible for the safety and security of the United States and its citizens. In this module, you can explore some of the conflicts that arose during President Clinton’s administration and the ways in which the President used military force to ensure the safety of the United States and its allies. Ethnic Cleansing in Bosnia In February 1992, the largely Muslim nation of Bosnia declared its independence from the ailing remnants of Yugoslavia. Two months later, Serbia, the most powerful of the former Yugoslav Republics, invaded Bosnia with the goal of annexing large swathes of the country for the creation of a “greater Serbia.” After making substantial gains, the Serbian Army settled into a system of ethnic cleansing, seeking to purge their occupied lands of all Bosnian Muslims. Click on the memo above to read an intelligence report detailing Serbia's war aims in Bosnia. Early on in the conflict, President Clinton followed the events while supporting peace talks spearheaded by the United Nations and European Commission. However, as the above intelligence report on Serbian War aims shows, Serbia was not likely to abide by the terms and had continued its campaign of ethnic cleansing while talks were held. For President Clinton, it was clear that the security of the Bosnian people, and perhaps the greater stability of the Balkans, hung in the balance. Click the document above to read a still partially classified report on ethnic cleansing in Bosnia.

Some scholars believe the Commander in Chief Clause confers expansive powers on the President, but others argue that even if that is the case, the Constitution does not define precisely the extent of those powers. These scholars tend to construe the Clause narrowly, asserting that the Founders gave the President the title to preserve civilian supremacy over the military, not to provide additional powers outside of a Congressional authorization or declaration of war. After the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon Administrations spent nearly a decade committing U.S. troops to Southeast Asia without Congressional approval, in 1973 Congress responded by passing the War Powers Resolution . The Resolution sought to halt the erosion of Congress's ability to participate in war-making decisions, an aim furthered by the Resolution's requirement that the President communicate to Congress the commitment of troops within 48 hours. Further, the statute requires the President to remove all troops after 60 days if Congress has not granted an extension. Presidents have typically considered the War Powers Resolution to be unconstitutional, and so they have tended not to follow it. This unwillingness has never been challenged by another actor (congress, civilians, etc), so the Supreme Court has never decided on the issue. (This is because the legislative branch is reactionary, meaning the Supreme Court could not get involved unless a suit is brought and makes its way up to the court). In one way, the resolution takes an unprecedented action by allowing the President to unilaterally put American troops into conflict.", "timestamp": "2015-03-09"}, {"doc_id": "d9", "source_url": "https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S2-C1-1-11/ALDE_00013473/", "snippet": "ArtII.S2.C1.1.11 Presidential Power and Commander in Chief Clause Under the Constitution, the President, in addition to being Chief Executive, is Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy.

Sure, you can post pictures and videos on Facebook and include them in your tweets on Twitter, but these were added as an afterthought. Instagram, on the other hand, was built around sharing images. The visual nature of Instagram makes it a natural fit for influencer marketing.

History of Coffee History of Coffee Historians are quite certain that coffee beans (actually \"pits\") were first eaten, not drunk, in Ethiopia, East Africa, around 575 A.D. There are several legends on how coffee was actually first discovered. The most popular story takes place in the foothills of Yemen in 850 A.D. It is said that a goat herder named Kaldi discovered that his goats were eating the leaves and berries from an unknown tree with cherry-like fruit. After a full meal the goats became full of pep and energy. Some even say that they were dancing. Kaldi suspected that the intoxication was caused by the berry the goats were eating. He tried the berry himself and found that he too was suddenly energetic. Soon a monk noticed Kaldi's vigor and asked the goatherder what caused it. Kaldi told him about the plant and the monk picked the berries and brought them back to the monastery where the monks used them to stay awake for late night prayer and study. Another story tells of a man condemned by his enemies to wander the desert and eventually die of starvation. In his delirium, the young man heard a voice instructing him to eat the fruit from a nearby coffee tree. Confused, he tried to soften the beans in water, and when this failed, he simply drank the liquid. Interpreting his survival and energy as a sign of God, he returned to his people, spreading the faith and the recipe. While these stories are surely fiction, historians do agree on the following: East African tribes would grind the coffee cherries together, mixing the results into a paste with animal fat. Rolled into little balls, the mixture was said to give warriors much-needed energy for battle. Later, around the year 1000 AD, Ethiopians concocted a type of wine from coffee berries, fermenting the dried beans in water.

We don’t have official documentation to confirm exactly who discovered coffee trees for the first time, or who invented coffee as the beverage we know today. However, we do have colorful legends we can use to piece together a rich tapestry of coffee history—and follow coffee’s journey across the globe. 9th Century: Innovation on the Ethiopian Plateau According to legend, a goat herder named Kaldi was the first person who discovered coffee beans and their benefits. Kaldi noticed that after his goats ate the cherries of a particular tree in the ancient coffee forests of the Ethiopian plateau, they were so full of energy that they didn’t want to sleep at night. Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who struggled to stay awake during the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot made a drink with the cherries and found that it kept him alert. In other words, according to the story, the person who invented coffee did so for the most relatable reason possible. After the abbot shared his discovery with the other monks at the monastery—sharing is caring, after all—knowledge of the energizing berries began to spread, moving east. 15th-16th Centuries: Coffee Culture Develops on the Arabian Peninsula The business edition of coffee history began on the Arabian Peninsula, where people cultivated and traded coffee for the first time. By the 15th century, coffee was being grown in what is now Yemen, and by the 16th century it gained popularity in what we now know as Iran, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey.

The origin of this phrase is in dispute; a common story is that in World War I the US Secretary of the Navy Josephus \"Joe\" Daniels banned alcohol on navy ships which meant that the strongest drink available aboard the ship was black coffee. Sailors began referring to coffee as a \"cup of Joe\" in reference to Daniels. However, this story may be apocryphal since the first written account of it was in 1930, some 15 years later. Another explanation is that a formerly popular nickname for coffee, jamoke, from mocha java, was shortened to Joe. A third origin story is that since coffee is such a commonly consumed beverage, it is the drink of the average Joe.[200][201][202] ^Bonné, Jon (29 October 2003). \"Meet espresso's exacting master\".

The world’s first coffee house opened in 1475 in Constantinople, now known as Istanbul. Visitors engaged in conversation, gossiped and caught up on news while enjoying their favourite coffee. The word quickly spread As it’s thought that coffee originated in Ethiopia, it’s also believed it made its way north across the red sea into Yemen in the 15th Century. It then started to be grown in the Yemeni district of Arabia, and by the 16th century it was known in Persia, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey. It was immensely popular for its qualities to help improve alertness and wakefulness, allowing people to devote more time to spiritual matters and praying. The world’s first coffee house The world’s first coffee house was opened in Constantinople in 1475, now known as Istanbul. Coffee was drunk at home as part of the daily routine, as well as to show hospitality to guests. Outside of the home, people visited coffee houses to not only drink coffee but to engage in conversation, listen to music, watch performers, play chess, gossip and catch up on news. Without the modern technologies we have today, coffee houses quickly became the epicentre for exchanging and gathering information. They were often referred to as “Schools of the Wise”. And with thousands of pilgrims visiting Mecca each year from all over the world, knowledge of this “wine of Araby”, as it quickly became known, began to spread. Over to Europe Then the course of coffee history begins to change. This exotic beverage certainly caused a stir for European travellers who were filled with intrigue and fascination.

The abbot shared his findings with other monks, and the knowledge of these “energizing berries” began to spread. It didn’t take long until the news of these beans traveled the world. What was Coffee Originally Called? The word “coffee” has roots in several languages. As news of the berries traveled through Yemen, it was called qahwah, a romantic term for wine. Through Turkey, it became the Turkish kahveh and then Dutch koffie before settling into the English word, coffee. What Did People Drink Before Coffee? While tea has been around since before our favorite goat herder happened upon the coffee bean tree, there were other drinks that were commonplace for morning consumption even before tea. Wine and beer were seen as breakfast drinks since ancient Greek times. In fact, in the 1800s, the English viewed beer as the only appropriate breakfast drink. Back then, no one was given a hard time for downing a mug of ale before heading off to work because beer for breakfast was commonplace. However, that was because the water could often kill you. And the actual alcohol content of beer was only 0.5 – 2.0%. It was rather weak but did provide the carbs needed to give energy and a full feeling to get people through the day. How was Coffee First Consumed? The coffee bean is found in the cherry-like fruit of a coffee plant. Very early on, the fruit would be mixed with animal fat to create a protein-rich snack bar. Evolving through fermentation processes and other uses, a drink was created by using the whole coffee fruit, including the beans and the hull.

Coffee became especially popular in Turkey, and the spread of the Ottoman Empire brought the beverage to many more places. The drink was introduced into one European country after another throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, likely starting with Venetian merchants. Many accounts are recorded of its prohibition or approval as a religious, political, and medical potion. Its association with Muslims and its novel stimulating effects led some to urge Pope Clement VIII to forbid it in the late 1500s, but the pope famously gave it his blessing after sampling the drink for himself. Coffee spread fairly rapidly throughout Europe, and by the end of the 17th century the drink was flourishing across Britain, the British colonies in America, and nearly all of continental Europe. Until the close of the 17th century the world’s limited supply of coffee was obtained almost entirely from the province of Yemen in southern Arabia. But with the increasing popularity of the beverage, the propagation of the plant spread rapidly to Java and other islands of the Indonesian archipelago in the 17th century and to the Americas in the 18th century. Coffee cultivation was started in the Hawaiian Islands in 1825. By the 20th century the greatest concentration of production was centred in the Western Hemisphere—particularly Brazil. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries industrial roasting and grinding machines came into use, vacuum-sealed containers were invented for ground roasts, and decaffeination methods for green coffee beans were developed. After 1950 the production of instant coffee was perfected. The popularity of instant coffee led to increased production of the cheaper Robusta beans in Africa. In 2020 the top coffee-producing countries were Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, Indonesia, and Ethiopia. Interest in organic, fair-trade, and sustainably grown coffee increased in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, leading to shifts in production methods in some places.

Initially, coffee was a luxury item, available only to the wealthy, and was primarily enjoyed in the comfort of private homes. However, it wasn’t long before coffee houses began to appear in the bustling port cities of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. Modeled after the vibrant coffeehouses of London, these establishments became popular gathering places for the exchange of ideas and news. One of the first coffee houses was in Boston named the London Coffee House originally in 1689, but the name was later changed to The American Coffee House. During the colonial era, coffee started to gain popularity as a patriotic alternative to tea, especially following the Boston Tea Party in 1773. As tensions between the American colonies and Britain escalated, drinking tea—a symbol of British taxation—was seen as unpatriotic. Coffee, on the other hand, became a symbol of resistance and independence. Founding fathers like Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin were known proponents of coffee, and Jefferson famously referred to it as “the favorite drink of the civilized world.” The Coffee Revolution: 19th Century Expansion The American Revolution further solidified coffee’s place in American society. With tea imports disrupted by the war, colonists turned to coffee, boosting demand and encouraging the growth of the coffee trade. By the end of the 18th century, coffee had firmly established itself in the hearts and cups of Americans, laying the foundation for its rise as the nation’s favorite drink. The 19th century marked a turning point in America’s relationship with coffee, transforming it from a niche indulgence into a nationwide staple.

With a peak that reaches 6,190 meters (20,310 feet) above sea level, Denali is the third-highest of the Seven Summits (the tallest peaks on all seven continents). Denali is about 210 kilometers (130 miles) north-northwest of Anchorage. Sixty million years ago, tectonic uplift pushed Earth's crust upward, forming Denali and the other Alaska Range mountains. Denali is the centerpiece of the Denali National Park and Preserve, which spans 2.4 million hectares (6 million acres) of land. “Denali” comes from Koyukon, a traditional Native Alaskan language, and means “the tall one.” This name had been used for many generations and was used by early non-Native researchers and naturalists. But in 1896, William A. Dickey, a prospector, began calling Denali “Mount McKinley,” in honor of William McKinley, a presidential candidate at the time. After McKinley became president and was later assassinated, Congress formally recognized the name in 1917, despite McKinley’s tenuous ties to Alaska (he had never visited). But Native Alaskans, as well as locals of varied backgrounds, continued to call the mountain Denali. In 1975, a movement began to rename the mountain Denali, but it was blocked by politicians in Ohio, McKinley’s home state.

Within the cell body there are chromosomes – these are DNA strands with the code written for humans within them. At the end of a DNA strand is a microscopic bundle of non-crucial DNA, so that none of the important stuff gets snipped off when the cell divides. A cell can divide itself about 50 times before it’s lost its ability to replicate.

Humans 'not even close' to reaching the maximum ... Living to 150? Humans ‘not even close’ to reaching the maximum lifespan ATHENS, Ga. — Human lifespans are capable of soaring past the current record of 122 years, with people possibly reaching the age of 150, a new study explains. According to a researcher at the University of Georgia, we are “not even close” to reaching the maximum potential lifespan. The findings are based on an analysis of mortality rates going back more than three centuries across 19 countries. Lead author Dr. David McCarthy describes the implications as “profound.” For most of recorded human history, the average life expectancy has been between 20 and 40 years. Today, humans live to be around 80 years-old. Improved nutrition, clean water, better sanitation, and the application of medical science have been key to prolonging life. Experts suspect genetic manipulation, calorie restriction, and new medicines may extend life even further. The team in the study combined reasoning and probability – known as Bayesian theory – to work out potential maximum longevity. Results showed mortality limits have only been postponed in recent years due to records being slow to increase. “As these cohorts attain advanced ages in coming decades, longevity records may therefore increase significantly. Our results confirm prior work suggesting that if there is a maximum limit to the human lifespan, we are not yet approaching it.” (Credit: Anna Shvets from Pexels) So, how long can people really live? Two years ago, another study found life expectancy has the capacity to almost double, going beyond 150. Those findings were based on blood samples from thousands of British and American participants. “Whether or not there is a limit to the human lifespan has been a subject of debate for millennia,” Dr. McCarthy continues. “Historical estimates of the maximum possible lifespan strongly suggest it has increased substantially over recorded history.” The Bible famously records the Hebrews as regarding 80 years as the maximum length of a human life. Around 1,000 years later, the ancient Romans set their official estimate at 100 or 110.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d5", "source_url": "https://guardian.ng/features/why-humans-cannot-live-beyond-150-years-by-study/", "snippet": "Why humans cannot live beyond 150 years, by study | The Guardian ...

They developed an app to predict the maximum lifespan. The study was published in the journal Nature Communications. Experts in biology and biophysics fed an artificial intelligence system vast amounts of Deoxy ribonucleic Acid (DNA)/genetic material and medical data, on hundreds of thousands of volunteers in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US). This allowed them to develop an AI-driven iPhone app that, with simple input from a user, can accurately estimate the rate of biological ageing and maximum lifespan. As part of the big data study, they found there were two key parameters responsible for human lifespan, both covering lifestyle factors and how the body responds. The first factor is biological age, linked to stress, lifestyle and disease, and the second is resilience, reflecting how quickly the first factor returns to normal. This allowed the team to determine that the longest any human is likely to ever live is 150 years; almost double the current UK average lifespan of 81 years. The discovery is based on blood samples from two different longitudinal DNA studies, analysed by the team from Gero, a Singapore-based biotech company and Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, New York.

But after Calment, there was no one else. It was 115 … 115 … 115.” To see if that perceived plateau was real, Dong, Milholland, and Vijg turned to two international databaseson longevity and worked out the oldest individuals who died in any given year. They specifically looked at France, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the U.S.—the four countries with the most supercentenarians, people who live to 110 years or more. The data were clear. Between the 1970s and early 1990s, our maximum age rose from around 110 to 115—and then stopped after 1995, shortly before Jeanne Calment died. In fact, Vijg’s team calculated that in any given year, the odds that at least one person in the world will live past their 125th birthday are less than 1 in 10,000. Despite sanitation, antibiotics, vaccines, and other medical advances, the oldest living people simply aren’t dying any later. They’re unlikely to either, regardless of calorie restriction, drugs like rapamycin, and all of our other efforts to slow the flow of sand through the hourglass. “In science, you never know,” says Vijg. “But I’ve not seen anything that I think would break through the ceiling.” The ceiling is probably hardwired into our biology.

Science is once again casting doubt on the idea that we could live to be nearly as old as the biblical Methuselah or Mel Brooks' famous 2,000-year-old man. New research from Singapore-base biotech company Gero looks at how well the human body bounces back from disease, accidents or just about anything else that puts stress on its systems. This basic resilience declines as people age, with an 80-year-old requiring three times as long to recover from stresses as a 40-year-old on average. This should make sense if you've ever known an elderly person who has taken a nasty fall. Recovery from such a spill can be lif- threatening for a particularly frail person, whereas a similar fall might put a person half as old out of commission for just a short time and teenagers might simply dust themselves off and keep going. Extrapolate this decline further, and human body resilience is completely gone at some age between 120 and 150, according to new analysis performed by the researchers. In other words, at some point your body loses all ability to recover from pretty much any potential stressor. The researchers arrived at this conclusion by looking at health data for large groups from the US, the UK and Russia. They looked at blood cell counts as well as step counts recorded by wearables. As people experienced different stressors, fluctuations in blood cell and step counts showed that recovery time grew longer as individuals grew older. The new research contains a certain amount of validation for the idea that humans start dying from the moment we're born, but the process seems to speed up significantly somewhere in the mid-thirties to mid-forties when the body's resilience starts to decline more steeply.

But the thing that's keeping the human body from reaching immortality is surprisingly mundane: over time, your body loses the \"physiological resilience,\" or the ability to bounce back, that you once had in your younger years.

Lead researcher Timothy Pyrkov is part of a Singapore-based biotech company called Gero (yes, the name itself is the prefix meaning \"old age\"). Gero's stated goal is \"hacking complex diseases and aging,\" setting a clear agenda for the research. For this longitudinal analysis, Gero collaborated with Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, New York and studied large groups of people in the U.S., U.K., and Russia. You Have to Read These The team broke down all the age groups in detail, differentiating between \"early adulthood\" (16- to 35-year-olds), \"middle ages\" (35- to 65-year-olds), and \"older ages\" (older than 65). Then, they examined both changes in blood cell counts and the number of steps the groups took, treating the two factors as \"hallmarks of aging\" that could help them chart the subjects' progress (or deterioration) over several months.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d9", "source_url": "https://www.research.colostate.edu/healthyagingcenter/2022/10/07/humans-cant-live-forever/", "snippet": "Humans Can't Live Forever - Center for Healthy Aging Life expectancy vs. lifespan It would make sense that with medicine and technological advances, illness and disease are treatable, allowing us to live in better health for longer periods of time. But, the lines are not that clear. Life expectancy and lifespan are two different factors of human well-being that measure longevity. Lifespan refers to the maximum number of years an individual can live, making lifespan unique to everyone. The longest recorded lifespan was Jeanne Calment who lived for 122 years and 5 months, making the maximum possible human lifespan 122 years and 5 months – that is, until someone outlives Calment. Life expectancy, on the other hand, refers to the average age an individual can expect to live at different stages of life. As humans age, physical and cognitive challenges can emerge, making life expectancy a dynamic measurement that changes based on different experiences and lifestyles of an individual. This does not mean that 48 years-old was considered “old” in say, the 1850s. But 48 was the average age that individuals could expect to live to during that time. It turns out that infant mortality rates sharply drive down the average life expectancy in a population (i.e., the number of child deaths in certain regions is so high that there are more childhood deaths than adult deaths, lowering life expectancy for that region). You might think that, since our ability to safely manage childbirth and provide childcare has vastly improved since the 19th century, then children would have a greater chance of surviving into adolescence and even older adulthood. While yes, this is true, and yes, it has certainly contributed to an increase in the human lifespan, humans have been living well into their 70s and 80s since ancient times. For instance, a first century writer, Pliny, dedicated a chapter of The Natural History to individuals who had lived the longest during that time. In the first century, three individuals had already lived to be 100.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d10", "source_url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10946839/Anti-ageing-living-youre-200-really-isnt-pipe-dream.html", "snippet": "Anti-ageing: Why living until you're 200 really isn't a pipe dream ... The idea of living for hundreds of years was once thought to be the pipe dream of billionaires and tech moguls. But scientists at the forefront of anti-ageing research believe they are on the cusp of developing a pill that could lead to people living to the age of 200 and beyond. Medical advances in the last century have led to humans in wealthy nations living into their 80s, almost double the average life expectancy at the turn of the 20th century. Improved nutrition, clean water, better sanitation and huge leaps in medicine have been key in prolonging human life. The oldest known person — the Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who sold canvases to Vincent Van Gogh when she was a girl in the late 1800s — lived to the age of 122, dying in 1997. There is some debate about whether humans can naturally live much beyond that age, but it is hoped that science will take human lifespans beyond what is currently thought possible. Dr Andrew Steele, a British computational biologist and author of a new book on longevity, told MailOnline there is no biological reason humans can't reach the age of 200. He believes the big breakthrough will come in the form of drugs that remove 'zombie cells' in the body, which are thought to be one of the main culprits of tissue and organ decay as we age. Pills that flush these cells out of the body are already in human trials in and could be on the market in as little as 10 years, according to Dr Steele, who believes someone reading this could make it to 150 with the help of the drugs. Another field in particular that piques the interest of anti-ageing scientists is the study of DNA of reptiles and other cold-blooded animals. Michigan State University experts have begun studying dozens different types of long-living reptiles and amphibians — including crocodiles, salamanders and turtles that can live as long as 120 years. The team hope they will uncover 'traits' that can also be targeted in humans.", "timestamp": ""}], "per_doc_notes": [{"doc_id": "d1", "verdict": "partially supports", "key_fact": "A study suggests humans could live up to 150 years, but no one has been verified to live past 122 years.", "quote": "Humans could live until the ripe old age of 150 years according to recent research – and scientists are racing to work out how.
