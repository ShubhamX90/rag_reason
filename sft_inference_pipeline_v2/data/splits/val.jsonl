Why Brain-to-Brain Communication Is No Longer Unthinkable Telepathy, circa 23rd century: The Vulcan mind meld, accomplished by touching the temples with the fingertips, is an accepted technique for advancing the plot of a “Star Trek” episode with a minimum of dialogue, by sharing sensory impressions, memories and thoughts between nonhuman characters. Telepathy, 2015: At the Center for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering of the University of Washington, a young woman dons an electroencephalogram cap, studded with electrodes that can read the minute fluctuations of voltage across her brain. She is playing a game, answering questions by turning her gaze to one of two strobe lights labeled “yes” and “no.” The “yes” light is flashing at 13 times a second, the “no” at 12, and the difference is too small for her to perceive, but sufficient for a computer to detect in the firing of neurons in her visual cortex. If the computer determines she is looking at the “yes” light, it sends a signal to a room in another building, where another woman is sitting with a magnetic coil positioned behind her head. A “yes” signal activates the magnet, causing a brief disturbance in the second subject’s visual field, a virtual flash (a “phosphene”) that she describes as akin to the appearance of heat lightning on the horizon. In this way, the first woman’s answers are conveyed to another person across the campus, going “Star Trek” one better: exchanging information between two minds that aren’t even in the same place. For nearly all of human history, only the five natural senses were known to serve as a way into the brain, and language and gesture as the channels out. Now researchers are breaching those boundaries of the mind, moving information in and out and across space and time, manipulating it and potentially enhancing it. This experiment and others have been a “demonstration to get the conversation started,” says researcher Rajesh Rao, who conducted it along with his colleague Andrea Stocco.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d2", "source_url": "https://www.alittlesparkofjoy.com/telepathy/", "snippet": "Telepathy: What Is It & How to Use Telepathic Powers When we think about communication, we usually refer back to speaking and writing. But what about connection through the mind? Before I knew much about telepathy, just hearing the word brought up mental images of superheroes with mystical powers. But the truth is, you don’t need a cape to be able to communicate with others mentally. Telepathy is a gift that we all possess–and telepathic abilities are much more natural than one might think. Passed down from our ancient ancestors, we all have the innate ability to connect with the consciousness of others. My personal hope is that through this article, I can help you connect with and strengthen your own telepathic powers. The practices that I have outlined here have certainly helped me take my own skills to the next level. WHAT IS TELEPATHY AND HOW TO USE TELEPATHY? Telepathy is the process of receiving thoughts or feelings from another person. It is a type of Extrasensory Perception (ESP.) Telepathy usually happens over distance and without the use of other senses like hearing or touch. There are several types of telepathic activities. Here are a few: Reading: Hearing or sensing what is going on in the mind of another. Communicating: Direct communication with another without speaking. Impressing: Planting something into another’s person’s mind. This could be a thought or a word. It might even be an image. Control: Influencing or controlling the actions of another person’s thoughts or actions. To understand telepathy, you have to understand our human makeup on a deeper level. As humans, we all have consciousness–the ability to be aware and to feel. It is everything you experience. We also have the ability to connect with the consciousness of others. This happens by aligning your own consciousness grid with the grid of another. Another way of thinking about this is to think about what is underneath the skin as vibrating energy. Like a radio, every one of us contains the ability to transmit a number of frequencies. When we are able to align our frequency with the vibration of another, we can communicate telepathically. We no longer need the other senses as we have a direct connection.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d3", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Telepathy-Sending-Telepathic-Anywhere/dp/B08DC5VX64", "snippet": "Mastering Telepathy: Sending Telepathic Message ... - Amazon.com In this era, indeed accepting that reality is considered unrealistic because we have to deal with belief systems that continue to amputate most of our abilities and replace them with ideas that we never stop fighting against. See how scientists criticize each other about the existence of psychic abilities and psychokinesis such as telepathy, clairvoyance, telekinesis, and so on. Theory after theory was built to erase historical evidence that our ancestors survived in conditions (which if we are experiencing today we will not be saved) by relying on natural human abilities, which today may be considered supernatural. If telepathy is a natural human ability, why is telepathy difficult to plan, difficult to learn, and difficult to master? Why can't everyone telepathy these days? Why can't telepathic experiences always be replicated? The problems in the practice and experience of telepathy today lie not in telepathy itself but in humans. Humans have left this ability for too long and then believe that telepathy is not real. We are not born in an environment that requires telepathic abilities so that telepathy becomes something foreign to us. Practicing telepathy today is the same as practicing walking after a long time sitting in a wheelchair; but walking is a natural human ability. We should be grateful that today there are books that re-open old pages about telepathy. Although we have to deal with science (which has not yet succeeded in discovering the scientific method of telepathy as well as the explanation behind telepathic experiences), telepathy is once again brought to life as a natural human ability. Let's accept the fact that telepathy has now become \"foreign\" both to \"ordinary people\" and to scientists. That's why we're all just learning telepathy today. This book, as the title suggests, gives you an explanation of telepathy and how to practice this ability. I wrote this book based on my telepathic communication experiences which I have reviewed and used as the basis for building a telepathic training method that is easy to do but takes time to master. You can also find semi-scientific explanations of telepathic phenomena and the causes of failure in telepathic communication in this book.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d4", "source_url": "https://davidmichie.com/do-animals-use-telepathy-to-communicate-intriguing-video-evidence/", "snippet": "Do animals use telepathy to communicate? Intriguing video ... They all also know if one of us, or one of their friends is unwell, and one time we had to keep one of our hens indoors with us overnight due to illness – in the morning her companion left the henhouse, knocked at the door to the house and made her way to the garage which she had never been in before, to find her best friend, who was quiet due to her illness, so it was not that she was following the sounds chickens make, rather they were communicating telepathically their whereabouts. In my years of experience working with animals I have to conclude that they are far superior in every way to humans who for the most part have forgotten most of their innate abilities such as intuition, telepathy and healing. David Michie Author Hi Clare, Thank you so much for these stories. I agree with your conclusion completely that animals have far superior intuition/telepathy and that for a variety of reasons humans have lost this capacity – at least, in many places. The interesting thing is that Buddhism regards these qualities of mind as completely natural and normal, and the masters of the tradition are generally known to be quite clairvoyant. Warm wishes, David Yes David, and I am sure that in most ways it is due to Buddhist avoidance of harm to and respect for all sentient beings that enabled the retention of all the natural qualities we mention. Only once the heart has hardened and the mind can ignore or in some way rationalise the suffering of others do we lose the empathy, understanding and ability to communicate in all ways with those who share our world. I believe that telepathic communication in the way we are discussing it is not simply a mind skill we can re-learn – we must engage the heart first and foremost to enable us to remember our connection to all life. Then it becomes as natural as spoken speech. And the animals themselves are our best teachers. Monica Montserrat Paulette Bartenstein My cats seem to project what they are doing into my dreams.

Although many people believe in psychic abilities, the scientific consensus is that there is no proof of the existence of such powers, and describes the practice as pseudoscience. The word \"psychic\" is also used as an adjective to describe such abilities. Critics attribute psychic powers to intentional trickery or to self-delusion.[4][5][6][7] In 1988 the U.S. National Academy of Sciences gave a report on the subject and concluded there is \"no scientific justification from research conducted over a period of 130 years for the existence of parapsychological phenomena\".[8] A study attempted to repeat recently reported parapsychological experiments that appeared to support the existence of precognition. Attempts to repeat the results, which involved performance on a memory test to ascertain if post-test information would affect it, \"failed to produce significant effects\" and thus \"do not support the existence of psychic ability\" of this kind.[9] Psychics are sometimes featured in science fiction and fantasy fiction. Examples of fiction featuring characters with psychic powers include the Star Wars franchise, which features \"Force-sensitive\" beings who can see into the future and move objects telekinetically, along with Dungeons & Dragons and some of the works of Stephen King, amongst many others. History Etymology The word \"psychic\" is derived from the Greek word psychikos (\"of the mind\" or \"mental\"), and refers in part to the human mind or psyche (ex. \"psychic turmoil\"). The Greek word also means \"soul\". In Greek mythology, the maiden Psyche was the deification of the human soul. The word derivation of the Latin psȳchē is from the Greek psȳchḗ, literally \"breath\", derivative of psȳ́chein, to breathe or to blow (hence, to live).[10]", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d6", "source_url": "https://aeon.co/essays/do-we-need-a-telepathy-machine-when-we-already-have-empathy", "snippet": "Do we need a telepathy machine when we already have empathy ... In the past decade or so, this research has revealed that we already have deep insights into what other people feel and think. We really do have a sixth sense, but it’s psychological rather than psychic, made up of an entirely natural and completely human blend of emotional intuition and clever reasoning. The more we know about empathy and ordinary human mind-reading, the less it looks like a way to achieve world peace. Technologically assisted telepathy could exaggerate flaws in our moral thinking and saddle us with unbearable intimacy, encouraging us to tune out the suffering of the most vulnerable. Emotional-mindreading is no guarantee of kindness; it is also how psychopaths and bullies manipulate and torment their victims. This research suggests an entirely sensible, completely ordinary, not-at-all-clairvoyant prediction about the future: rather than a dreamy bliss of togetherness, artificial telepathy would be a nightmare. This new appreciation of the limitations of empathy is in part the result of a surprising discovery about brain organisation. One of the general rules of neurobiology is that many mental tasks are handled by dedicated anatomical regions of the brain. The motor cortex, for example, controls body movements. The visual cortex is specialised for processing information from your eyes. Other parts are for remembering, for analysing objects, for feeling emotions, or for functions as specific as verbal fluidity or measuring rewards. So if you watch a ball roll down a hill, for example, parts of your brain involved in recognising objects, analysing movements, and ensuring that your eyes move in sync with an object all become active. This rule of thumb still holds, but a big asterisk was put next to it in the 1990s, when a group of Italian scientists discovered that primate brains analyse the actions of other similar creatures in a special way. Their discovery was initially made with monkeys, but something similar happens in humans too: as you watch another person do something, your brain responds with a rough mental simulation of the action.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d7", "source_url": "https://positively.com/contributors/what-is-animal-communication/", "snippet": "What is Animal Communication? | Victoria Stilwell Positively In various cases that I’ve worked on, the animal has been able to share particular tastes with me in response to questions that I’ve asked. For example, if the animal is being treated with a medication that’s leaving an unusual taste in the animal’s mouth, I will also be able to taste that medicine the same way in which the animal is experiencing it. Finally, sometimes animals will share their feelings or emotions with me. The feelings and emotions that an animal is able to express are much like our own feelings and emotions. They can convey joy, laughter, dissatisfaction for something or love for a particular person in their home. Another interesting point is that much like us, some animals can be very communicative while others are not. However, I have yet to encounter an animal that has declined my request to communicate with them on behalf of their human companion. In fact, most welcome it as a way to let their human companion know what their preferences are or, if they are not feeling well. Animals use telepathy as their main method of communicating with each other. An example of animals using telepathic communication is when a flock of geese need to change their formation. The lead goose falls to the back of the line in order to catch the draft and rest. The other geese move up in formation and a new goose takes the lead. In order to perform this task simultaneously, the geese will communicate telepathically. The Aborigines of Australia, Native Americans and even very young children up to the age of 5 or 6 years of age know how to freely communicate using telepathy – regardless of the distance between each other. Unfortunately, due to societal influences, the development of telepathic abilities has not always been encouraged. The important thing to remember about being successful in using telepathy with animals is to first relax by quieting the mind and body and then becoming centered. Using guided meditation is an excellent way to relax and open your mind and heart. Once this is done, opening a telepathic connection becomes very easy to do. Animal communication is often used in conjunction with many traditional and alternative healing modalities for animals.

Psychic abilities are those that allow an individual to sense, feel and perceive things beyond the five senses. It is a natural human ability that we all possess but some people are more in touch with their psychic side than others. There are many different types of psychic abilities including telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition, mediumship, and psychokinesis. Psychic Abilities and ESP Psychic powers and abilities are often associated with extrasensory perception (ESP) which is the ability to receive and interpret information that is not gained through the five senses. We all have some intuition which is a form of ESP but some people are more attuned to their intuition and can use it to give them information about people and events. Recognizing Psychic Experiences Most people have had a psychic experience at some point in their lives whether they realize it or not. These experiences can come in the form of a hunch, gut feelings, or seeing things in your mind’s eye. If you have ever had a strong feeling about something that later turned out to be true, you may have experienced precognition which is the ability to see future events. If you have experienced things like this from a young age, it is possible that you have some type of natural psychic power or ability with magical thinking. 10 Types of Psychic Ability Clairvoyance: This is the ability to see events or people that are not physically present. This can come in the form of visions, daydreams, or even dreams. Clairaudience: This is the ability to hear things that are not physically present. This can come in the form of hearing voices or sounds that others cannot hear. Clairsentience: This is the ability to feel things that are not physically present. This can come in the form of emotions, sensations, or even physical pain. Telepathy: This is the ability to communicate with others without using words. This can be done by reading minds or sending and receiving thoughts. Precognition: This is the ability to see future events before they happen. This can be done through dreams, visions, or Gut feelings.

Sure, it’s one thing to pick up on what people are feeling, but it’s something completely different when you actually start to understand where their feelings are coming from. That’s when you know it’s true telepathy because you can actually tell them exactly why they are feeling the way they are. A lot of people have trouble expressing their feelings, and it can get really hard to understand the full spectrum of them if you don’t know what they’re talking about. However, if you can pick up on their feelings just by looking at them, then that’s a pretty strong indicator that you have telepathic abilities. 14) You have a strong sense of knowing when someone is lying to you Telepathy is all about sensing emotions and thoughts without words, so it makes sense that a lot of telepathic people can read emotions like lies incredibly well. You know when someone has been lying to you just by looking in their eyes, or from how they’ve reacted to your questions. This skill can come in incredibly handy in life, especially when you choose to pursue a profession where that ability plays a huge role. It can also just be a fun game for yourself, playing the human lie detector! 15) You can easily influence or persuade others The next sign that you have telepathic abilities is that you are able to influence or persuade other people. There are a lot of people who can influence others because they possess telepathic abilities. They can tell when someone is going to change their mind, and they are able to make them see things the way they want them to see them. This skill will come in handy in any kind of job, whether you’re a lawyer, doctor, or even an actor. Of course, you might want to be careful how far you take this skill. At what point does it become unfair to influence or persuade other people with your abilities? That choice is up to you, but make sure to not take advantage of people when you know you are persuasive. 16)", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d10", "source_url": "https://paizo.com/threads/rzs2ulll?Ruling-for-Limited-Telepathy", "snippet": "Ruling for Limited Telepathy - paizo.com - Forums: Rules Questions Telepathy is the same as talking, but with your mind. Unlike vocal speech, telepathy allows you to \"speak\" at a single or multiple individuals. This power, however, does not confer mind-reading abilities, merely the ability to speak using your mind rather than voice. Therefore, only creatures with telepathic abilities can actually respond using their mind, as they lack the ability to \"speak\" that way. As far as objects go - there's nothing in the limited telepathy ability description, or the Telepathy spell description that indicates it's blocked by normal walls. I'm sure there are all sorts of ways a GM could cook up to to limit that if need be though... maybe a faraday cage for telepaths or something, but that's a side point. So, under this ruling: 1. Shirren #1 wants to talk to Shirren #2: No one else can hear, they can talk to each other mentally as they both possess limited telepathy. 2. Shirren #1 wants to talk to Human #1. The human can hear, but no one else can. The human can only talk back using it's normal voice as it does not possess telepathic powers (under normal circumstances). 3. Shirren #1 wants to talk to Lashuntas #1 and Human #1. The Shirren can speak to both at once mentally, and both can hear. The Lashunta can respond mentally such that both can hear the response. The human must speak out loud. 4. Shirren #1 wants to talk to the whole group. Yes, the Shirren can mentally address anyone within his limited telepathy range, but only those with telepathy can respond in kind. Oops, sorry about the double-post.

Animals Are Natural Empaths There is no doubt that animals are very responsive to spirits and are naturally in tune with more energetic frequencies than their humans’ counterparts- This is because we developed unconscious blocking mechanisms when we leave childhood. We tend to alienate our natural abilities rather than nurturing and developing our connective skills. Animals, to the contrary, can be very empathic, even sometimes they can present some “medium” capabilities. Maybe because of their innate innocence, they reside closer to the Divine, giving them a deeper and broader understanding of the natural world, including the unseen world of spirits. Much of the mediumship in animals is often underestimated or dismissed as an instinct or genetic memory. But animals do have an ability to exchange information through telepathy and other forms of energy transference. The Gift of Telepathy in Animals Telepathy – through images, sensations, understanding, and empathy – is the heart of the spiritual, linguistic matrix. It is also our common metaphysical language with animals, combining with vocalizations, gestures, facial expressions, and body language. Animals can communicate with each other across species and inter-dimensionally due to their continuous affirmation and acceptance of their intuitive access. It is humans who weaken these more profound forms of communication through doubt, fear, misuse, disuse, and other barriers that animals naturally do not have. Animals can help us demystify telepathy and broaden our awareness of the world. Animal Mediumship as a Spiritual Gift Like, in different people, each animal is unique and endowed with unusual gifts, and some are more spiritually fit than others. Some are young souls with limited understanding of their mission and purpose, while others have learned spiritual mastery through many lifetimes of experience.

Comic fans in the early 2000s were not pleased with such a significant change from the source material and Cameron’s crude ideas. One fan was quoted as expressing disinterest in an additional mutation further alienating Peter Parker from his peers when his awkward demeanor already did that sufficiently enough. There was at least one website created that was dedicated to preventing the Spider-Man film from using the idea. Ultimately, the organic-web shooters were handled tastefully by Raimi, who used the concept to support his goal of emphasizing the natural evolution of Peter Parker. The Organic Webbing Is Tobey Maguire Spider-Man's USP Following Spider-Man: No Way Home, there are now three on-screen Spider-Men in Marvel's ever-growing cinematic multiverse. While there are no concrete plans to bring back Maguire's Spider-Man for another crossover or a possible Spider-Man 4, it's very possible given the financial success of No Way Home and Marvel's ongoing interest in multiverse stories. In this new multiverse, Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man having organic web shooters makes him distinct from other iterations of the character. Maguire's Peter Parker's organic powers are a sign of how he is portrayed as more of an ordinary, emotional young adult instead of a scientific whiz kid. Raimi's Spider-man movies provided the MCU a template for relatable superheroes, but the success of the latter also accustomed audiences to more complex plots of the type found in long-running comic books.

He got Organic web later in the Comics series. In the Sam Raimi's trilogy of Spider-Man he does not follow the real Spider-Man comics story as it is and skipped the Artificial Web-shooters thing and even skipped the main characters like Gwen Stacy. So, you can say that it's the director's/writer's choice to choose which aspects they grasp from the original content or not. Here is some description of his main powers from origin to now in main universe of Marvel Comics - Original abilities When Peter Parker was bitten by a lethally irradiated spider, radioactive mutagenic enzymes in the spider's venom quickly caused numerous body-wide changes.

Of course it doesn't have to relate and I say as such in my answer. However, as they are the only two universes with organic webs it makes sense there would be some relation. I'll start this with pointing out a difference between the semantics of \"web\" and \"cobweb\". The difference implies that a \"web\" is maintained, and a \"cobweb\" is abandoned. Comparing the two, you can notice a difference in both strength and stickiness. I personally have experienced webs that were surprisingly resilient to being broken - similar to plucking a leaf from a tree almost. Whereas entire cobwebs can be brushed away by hand. Additionally, while a cobweb might \"stick\" to you when you walk through one, you can simply brush it off, whereas with a web, you do need to actually pull it off. The adhesiveness is caused by fluid coating the web in places, which would \"dry up\" over time and lose its adhesiveness. Now, in the comic series, Spider-Man is mostly known for his mechanical web shooter, and his special formula for its rapid disintegration. However, after constantly having to deal with running out of ammo, Peter does actually develop organic shooters. Since this was actually developed after the initial creation of the mechanical web shooters, it likely follows a similar design, i.e. the quick disintegration style. However, in the movies, Peter starts with this power. There is very little talk about this, other than the constant debate about whether or not it was a good idea, so there is little else other than assumption that can be mode here. However, it can be explained with several assumptions: It acts exactly the same way as normal spider webs. After a time, it simply disintegrates on its own.

That being said, Stan Lee wanted Peter to be a relatable character, but also show off more of an intellect than money or reputation.

Medication and Follow-up Care Costs After heart valve replacement surgery, patients may require medications to prevent infection, reduce the risk of blood clots, and manage other post-surgical complications. The cost of these medications can vary depending on factors such as insurance coverage and the specific medications prescribed. Some medications may need to be taken for a short period, while others may be required for a longer duration. It is important for patients to discuss the potential costs of these medications with their healthcare provider and explore options for financial assistance if needed. In addition to medications, regular follow-up care appointments with cardiologists and surgeons are necessary to monitor recovery and ensure optimal heart function. These appointments may involve additional costs, including diagnostic tests and imaging studies. The frequency and duration of follow-up care will depend on the individual patient's needs and the recommendations of their healthcare team. It is essential for patients to factor in these ongoing costs when planning for heart valve replacement surgery. Understanding the financial implications and exploring options for financial assistance or insurance coverage can help alleviate some of the financial burden associated with the procedure. Leave stressful medical bills behind Even if youâre being hounded by collection agencies, itâs still not too late to fight your medical bill. The Emotional and Psychological Costs Heart valve replacement not only impacts patients physically but also emotionally and psychologically. The journey through surgery and recovery can be challenging for patients and their loved ones.

According to a 2020 study , the average cost of aortic valve replacement surgery is about $59,000. What to know about heart valve replacement surgery When parts of the heart, such as the valves, do not work properly, it is possible to repair or replace them. The aortic and mitral valves are the ones that surgeons most commonly replace. Most valve replacement surgeries are successful. When a person needs a heart valve replacement, doctors may use one of the following types of valves for the procedure: mechanical valves allografts, which are made from tissues harvested from a donor’s heart pig valves cow valves Surgery A doctor may also recommend the Ross Procedure for a damaged aortic valve. This procedure involves swapping the person’s damaged aortic valve with their pulmonary valve and replacing the pulmonary valve with a donor valve. Replacing a heart valve often involves open-heart surgery. However, another option is transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), a less invasive procedure. Newer surgical techniques are emerging, such as robot-assisted procedures, which are also less invasive. Preparation for a valve replacement depends on the type of procedure a person is having. Prior to open-heart surgery, people will typically meet with the medical team performing the procedure to discuss the steps involved and any possible risks and complications. People will likely have to stay in the hospital the night before surgery to have blood work and other testing done. They must not eat after midnight before the surgery. Before the surgery, a hospital employee will shave the surgical area and direct the person to put on a hospital gown. They may administer a sedative to help the person relax. They will then move the person to the operating area, where the person will receive general anesthesia. Open-heart valve replacement This type of replacement procedure involves opening up the chest to replace a damaged valve. To replace a valve, the medical team will have to stop the heart for 1 hour and use a heart-lung machine to continue circulating blood in the person’s body. Once the surgeons close the incision, the person will go to the intensive care unit (ICU).", "timestamp": "2022-08-31"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "source_url": "https://www.heart-valve-surgery.com/costs-fees-estimates-money-insurance.php", "snippet": "Costs of Heart Valve Surgery Cost per patient was $14,469 for mitral valve replacement, and $11,606 for mitral valve repair. At East Carolina University, surgeons say that ... Costs of Heart Valve Surgery My number one priority for heart valve surgery focused on finding the right surgeon. I remember thinking, “Money is no object for this procedure. I don’t care what it costs. I want to find the best surgeon. I want the best care. I will go anywhere to have this done. I’ll worry about the fees afterward.” A long time ago, a friend once said to me, “When you die, the money in your bank account is irrelevant.” That might be cliche, but I believe it. That is why I was so adamant about finding the top cardiac surgeon for my heart valve replacement. Still, one of the most curious questions I had about heart valve surgery was, “How much is valve surgery going to cost me?” Unfortunately, no one I spoke with seemed to have a reliable answer to that question. My uncle told me, “A procedure like that will probably cost over $100,000.” Another buddy said, “My cousin had some valve work done... I hear it cost him $200,000.” I then went to the Internet and searched the world wide web for an answer. I never really found anything that detailed how much a heart valve surgery actually cost the patient. Eventually though, I found three references to heart valve surgery costs from Columbia University, The National Library of Medicine and East Carolina University. Here is what the references said: Columbia University. Between 1992 and 1997, length of hospital stay decreased from 13.4 to 8.0 days and cost decreased from $37,047 to $21,856. Similarly, between 1992 and 1997 for mitral valve repair, length of stay decreased from 15.6 to 8.1 days and cost decreased from $45,072 to $21,747. The net result over the time period from 1988 to 1997 was an average decline in the cost of operation of $785 a year, adjusted for other factors.

The cost of a typical heart valve replacement can differ by several thousand dollars. The range, however, is from $5,000 to $7,000 for a typical valve.” Another surgeon told me, “I can not provide specifics but heart valve replacements range from $2,000 to $10,000.” Financial reports indicate that new transcatheter solutions, like the Edwards’ Sapien valve replacement, can cost over $25,000. On one hand, you might react to those numbers with this thought, “Holy Moly! That’s a lot of money!” On the other hand, you might think, “That’s it! To keep me alive for another 10, 20 or 30 years… That’s nothing!” (Personally, the latter thought rushed through my brain as I digested these numbers.) Regardless of how you view the cost of heart valve replacement devices, we should probably remember that mechanical and bioprosthetic devices fall into the life sciences product category. The leading valve manufacturers — Edwards, Medtronic, ATS, St. Jude — have to extend millions, or even billions, of dollars on research and development (R&D) before they make one penny on a product sale. That said, pricing usually starts high as R&D costs are recouped. Then, over time, pricing decreases – just like the computer in front of you. Remember when a laptop computer was $4,000? As you can tell, I’m not a heart valve pricing guru. I have no idea where valves fall on the long-run pricing curve. But, I hope this information helps Mike (and perhaps you) learn more about the price of heart valve replacement devices.

Sure, you can post pictures and videos on Facebook and include them in your tweets on Twitter, but these were added as an afterthought. Instagram, on the other hand, was built around sharing images. The visual nature of Instagram makes it a natural fit for influencer marketing. So, it comes as no surprise when you look at some of the following statistics to see how well influencer marketing and Instagram go together. 1. More Than 1 Billion Active Instagram Users Instagram began in 2010. It reached 100 million active users in February 2013 - a number that people considered excellent at the time.

Michael PHELPS Biography Michael Phelps is arguably the greatest Olympian ever. Some might argue that Usain Bolt, Carl Lewis or Nadia Comaneci have a claim. But for sheer numbers of medals claimed, there is a clear, hands-down winner: Michael Phelps. Even given the fact that Phelps practices a sport in which extremely capable athlete can bag golds across different distances and strokes, his feats still blow away those of any other sportsperson. Phelps has 28 medals in total: his 23 gold medals are more than double the count of his nearest rivals, and its not as if other swimmers have accrued silly numbers of medals, either. Apart from Spitz, Matt Biondi (USA, eight golds) and Jenny Thompson (USA, eight golds), no other swimmer worldwide has managed more than six gold medals in total. 23 is astonishing. Phelps was born in Baltimore on June 30, 1985, and got serious with the sport after joining the North Baltimore Aquatic Club. He was raised by mother Deborah, alongside his sisters Hilary and Whitney, after his parents divorced. A prodigy at his sport, he went to Sydney 2000 aged just 15 –the youngest man in the USA team for an Olympic Games in 68 years). He came close to the podium only in the 200m butterfly, where he finished fifth. From then on, he would dominate the next four Games, finishing the most decorated athlete at every one. In Athens he won six gold medals and two bronzes, falling just short of Mark Spitz’s world record (seven golds at Munich 1972). Beijing 2008 would see the greatest ever medal haul by a single athlete in an Olympic Games. Phelps won eight golds – every event he entered – and broke World Records in seven of them.

Russia banned tobacco for 70 years from 1627.[26] The Ottoman Sultan Murad IV prohibited smoking in his empire in 1633 and had smokers executed.[25] The earliest citywide European smoking bans were enacted shortly thereafter.

Although senators never smoked in the chamber during public sessions, they happily brought out their cigars whenever the Senate went into executive session to consider nominations and treaties. During most executive sessions, until 1929, doorkeepers cleared the galleries and locked the doors. No longer on public display, members removed their ties and jackets, and lit their cigars. In this relaxed setting, senators more readily resolved their differences over controversial nominees and complex treaties. In 1914, South Carolina Democrat Benjamin Tillman was one of the Senate's most senior members. Always a controversial figure, Tillman was best remembered for a speech at the 1896 Democratic National Convention in which he prodded President Grover Cleveland to adopt policies that would aid economically strapped farmers of the South. Otherwise, he promised, he would go to the White House and “poke old Grover with a pitchfork.” For the rest of his colorful career, the fiery South Carolina senator would be known as “Pitchfork Ben.” After 1910, however, a series of strokes slowed his pace. His precarious medical condition led him to try various unconventional health regimens. They included deep breathing, drinking a gallon of water each day, a vegetarian diet, and avoidance of tobacco. Concerned for his own well-being, along with that of his colleagues, in the often smoke-filled chamber that he likened to a “beer garden,” Tillman introduced a resolution to ban smoking there. Noting the high death rate among incumbent senators—within the previous four years 14 had died, along with the vice president and sergeant at arms—he surveyed all members. Non smokers responded that they would like to support him, but worried that their smoking colleagues would consider this a selfish gesture.

This policy is believed to have been inspired by New Zealand New Zealand's previous government wanted to have a sweeping crackdown on smoking and introduced a law which meant anyone born after 2008 would not be able to buy cigarettes or tobacco products in their lifetime. It also restricted where tobacco could be sold. But the current government elected in October 2023 moved to repeal the law saying it would help fund tax cuts. Other countries are hoping to raise 'smoke-free generations' One of Australia's largest states, Queensland, has created several smoke-free public spaces, including restrictions on smoking at campsites, public swimming pools and playgrounds. Canada is hoping to reduce tobacco use to less than 5% by 2035 and was one of the first countries to rule that health warnings should be printed on individual cigarettes. Over 70 countries have 'smoke-free' policies that cover indoor places Construction Photography/Avalon No smoking sign at a train station in Spain In 2004, Ireland was the first country to pass a \"smoke-free law\", according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).

In an article published in the 12 April 2007 New England Journal of Medicine, Connolly and colleague Howard Koh, an HSPH professor of public health practice, wrote that “more than 20 high-quality studies have shown no negative economic effect of smoke-free policies on restaurants and bars.” Finally, mounting evidence shows that comprehensive smoking bans produce real health benefits. In Ireland, indoor air contaminants in pubs have fallen dramatically since the ban came into force, according to a study by Clancy and colleagues that was published in the 15 April 2007 issue of the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. From just prior to the ban to a year later, there was an 83% reduction in fine particulate matter and an 80.2% reduction in benzene concentrations in the pubs, along with a 79% reduction in exhaled breath carbon monoxide and an 81% reduction in salivary cotinine among nonsmoking pub workers. After the ban, the workers also showed statistically significant improvements in measured pulmonary function tests and far fewer self-reported respiratory and upper airway symptoms. In Massachusetts, the ban may have the potential to accelerate a drop in cigarette sales, which are now half what they were when the state began its comprehensive tobacco control program in 1993. Connolly says rising cigarette taxes account for one-third of the drop in tobacco consumption—an article by Kenneth Warner, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Public Health that was published in the June 2005 issue of the American Journal of Public Health showed that for every 10% rise in cigarette taxes, sales drop by 8%. The rest of the drop is attributed to efforts including public smoking bans, mass media messages, smoking cessation services, and enforcement of laws preventing youth access to tobacco products.", "timestamp": "2004-03-29"}], "per_doc_notes": [{"doc_id": "d1", "verdict": "partially supports", "key_fact": "Some states implemented comprehensive smoking bans in the late 1990s and early 2000s.", "quote": "In the late 1990s and early 2000s, some states implemented comprehensive smoking bans that prohibited smoking in most workplaces and all public places,", "verdict_reason": "Provides an approximate timeframe for when smoking bans began but not a specific date or national implementation, so only partial support.", "source_quality": "high"}, {"doc_id": "d2", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "Smoking was banned in all public places in the United Kingdom in 2007.", "quote": "Smoking was banned in all public places in the whole of the United Kingdom in 2007, when England became the final region to have the legislation come into", "verdict_reason": "The snippet explicitly states that the UK smoking ban came into effect in 2007, directly answering the query.", "source_quality": "high"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "verdict": "partially supports", "key_fact": "The snippet describes that San Luis Obispo, California, adopted the first U.S. law eliminating smoking in bars in 1990, but it does not specify a single nationwide smoking ban date.", "quote": "In 1990, the community of San Luis Obispo, California, adopted the first law in the United States eliminating smoking in bars.", "verdict_reason": "Provides an early example and timeline of smoking bans but lacks a clear national or general implementation date.", "source_quality": "high"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "verdict": "partially supports", "key_fact": "Some states implemented comprehensive smoking bans in the late 1990s and early 2000s.", "quote": "In the late 1990s and early 2000s, some states implemented comprehensive smoking bans that prohibited smoking in most workplaces and all public places,", "verdict_reason": "The snippet gives an approximate timeframe for when smoking bans were implemented but not a specific date or a single nationwide start, so only partial support.", "source_quality": "high"}, {"doc_id": "d5", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "The U.S. Senate agreed to ban smoking in its chamber on March 9, 1914.", "quote": "On March 9, 1914, the Senate unanimously agreed to ban smoking in its chamber.", "verdict_reason": "The snippet explicitly provides the date and action of the smoking ban, directly answering the query.", "source_quality": "high"}, {"doc_id": "d6", "verdict": "partially supports", "key_fact": "The snippet lists several smoking restrictions, including a 1990 citywide ban in San Luis Obispo, but does not specify a single national smoking ban date.", "quote": "1990 San Luis Obispo, California becomes the first city in the world to eliminate smoking in all public buildings, including bars and restaurants.", "verdict_reason": "Provides an early local smoking ban date but not when a general or national smoking ban came, so only partial support.", "source_quality": "high"}, {"doc_id": "d7", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "Ireland introduced a smoke-free law in 2004, marking the start of smoking bans.", "quote": "In 2004, Ireland was the first country to pass a \"smoke-free law\", according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).", "verdict_reason": "Explicitly provides the year 2004 as when a smoking ban law was first passed.", "source_quality": "high"}, {"doc_id": "d8", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "Governor Granholm signed Michigan's Public Act 188 of 2009 into law on December 18, 2009, establishing the state's smoking ban.", "quote": "Governor Granholm signed Public Act 188 of 2009 into law on December 18, 2009.", "verdict_reason": "The snippet explicitly provides the date when Michigan's smoking ban law was enacted.", "source_quality": "high"}, {"doc_id": "d9", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "Ireland implemented a nationwide smoking ban on 29 March 2004, covering all indoor workplaces including restaurants and bars.", "quote": "On 29 March 2004, Ireland became the first country in the world to ban smoking in all indoor workplaces, including in restaurants and bars.", "verdict_reason": "Explicitly provides the date and event of the smoking ban, directly answering the query.", "source_quality": "high"}], "conflict_reason": "d1, d3, d4, and d6 describe early or state-level U.S. bans (1990–2000s), d5 notes a 1914 Senate rule, d2 covers the UK’s 2007 law, and d7–d9 detail Ireland’s 2004 nationwide ban; these distinct regional and temporal contexts complement each other to form a complete timeline.", "answerable_under_evidence": true, "expected_response": {"answer": "Smoking bans were introduced at different times in various places.

Set to fly from p(doom)–the group’s recently established independent record label–on August 9, the latest offering is still shrouded in intrigue, with no release accompanying its first announcement; fans will have to hold out until July 9 for the first single and an accompanying music video directed by Guy Tyzack, who previously created the video for “Black Hot Soup” from King Gizzard’s acclaimed leftfield 2021 project Butterfly 3000. Given the band’s trademark breakneck release schedule, the 10 months that have passed since the group’s electrified 2023 project The Silver Cord and the forthcoming album have been an uncharacteristically long wait for King Gizzard’s passionate following. In the terse album announcement post, the band offers that it has “Been working real hard on this one. So excited for you all to hear it!” While the genre-contorting psych-fusion expeditionaries have never stayed in one sound for long, its past few years have seen rapid shape-shifting, assuming influence from metal, trance, krautrock, thrash and more. While none of the 10 tracks on the new project have seen official studio releases yet, the band debuted “Mirage City,” “Sad Pilot,” “Raw Feel,” “Daily Blues,” and “Le Risqué” on its recent European tour.

We wanted to make something fun.” The group booked in two weeks at their studio and worked Monday to Friday, “like factory workers”, clocking in and then rocking out. “We came in with the roughest skeletons for songs,” says Mackenzie, “and tried to keep the arrangements simple, free and easy. The best takes were always the ones where we were winging it pretty significantly.” “This is our most collaborative record – the collaboration was occurring in the room, it was free, and everyone was bringing in songs and ideas,” says Mackenzie. “And we wanted to have as many lead vocalists as we could, and to pass the mic, like, ‘This is my part, my idea, I’m gonna sing it and then I’m gonna pass the mic along to you and you can do your thing’. The whole record is built around that. We ended up doing a lot of backing vocals and extra recording, everyone in a room around a couple of microphones, just to give it that feel. The new single features the vocal debut of drummer Michael Cavanagh, and is accompanied by an aviation themed video. Director Guy Tyzack said: “We were super lucky to have been granted access to this amazing air hanger. The song was chosen because most of the Gizz guys had a singing part and I was excited for the mic to be passed around at a fun, never stopping pace. The day was super packed tight for what we wanted to get and we didn't want to cut corners. Our crew was tight and the Gizz guys know how to put on a show.

In the series finale, it is revealed that Lois intended him to have a hard life, knowing that he is destined to assume the role of President of the United States. Lois wants him to remember where he came from to get there and help families like his own when he assumes the office.

Malcolm in the Middle is an incredible show. My feeling toward the show was rather mixed when they began showing promos. It looked funny, but silly and unoriginal. After all, the concept of a family that doesn't get along is nothing new. The show turned out to be better than I expected. It's not a live action version of The Simpsons like some critics claim, but it is very funny. Don't be quick to judge the show or you might find the jokes go over your head. Thumbs up on this one. Storyline Did you know Bryan Cranston did several of his own stunts. Besides the cartwheel and the headstand, he did his own roller disco skating, spending all the free time he had in the 1-1/2 weeks he had to learn how to skate. After one of the show's writers asked jokingly whether Cranston would be willing to wear a suit of live bees, he said he would, so they wrote a script around the idea (The Bots and the Bees (2000)). He ended up covered in 10,000 bees, and only got stung once. Throughout his appearances in seasons 1-3, Commandant Edwin Spangler wears decorations that absolutely make no sense. While his uniform is clearly that of an USAF general, he nonetheless wears both the Pistol Expert and Rifle Expert badges of the USMC, while also sporting the ribbons for several decorations available solely to personnel of the US Army - the Army Distinguished Service Medal, the Soldier's Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, the Army Overseas Service Ribbon, and the Army Service Ribbon (the latter two worn in the wrong order of precedence).", "timestamp": "2000-03-19"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "source_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_in_the_Middle", "snippet": "Malcolm in the Middle - Wikipedia The ensemble cast includes Jane Kaczmarek and Bryan Cranston as Malcolm's parents, Lois and Hal.

Here he meets and marries Piama (Emy Coligado), a woman of Inuit heritage. When the camp closes, he later moves to a Wild West-themed hotel and ranch in the western U.S. called the Grotto, run by kindly but eccentric German Otto Mannkusser and his wife Gretchen.

We’ve been led to believe our furry feline friends want nothing to do with water – aside from drinking, of course, which they seem to prefer to do from the toilet bowl. So when it comes to the thought of hygiene for a cat, many people scratch their heads or even find the idea a bit humorous. If you have a cat that seems to flinch at the sound of a faucet turning, then why would you think that bathing a cat would be a good idea? We may sometimes want to dress them up (whether they cooperate or not) or give them human names, but in the end we have to realize they are not human.

Let’s debunk: One Main Reason Bathing a Cat Can Be Essential: Situational Cats can sure be adventurous at times. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as it is instinctual!

Regular grooming sessions, either yourself or with a registered cat groomer, can help to check your kitty for abnormalities like lumps, bumps or skin conditions, which are best caught early for the necessary treatment. Should you wash your cat? If you’re wondering about bathing a cat and whether it is really necessary, you may be glad to hear that cats actually have everything they need to keep themselves clean. Most cats, especially short-haired breeds, are excellent self-groomers, but you may need to bathe a cat in extreme circumstances. For example, if your cat has been unwell with diarrhoea or has been stuck up a chimney and is covered in soot, you may need to wash their coat. Bathing a cat can also help to reduce shedding, which is great news if you’re the owner of a long-haired feline. Showering rinses away dead hair but you can always achieve a similar result with brushing alone. Finally, if your cat is a purebred and you’re taking them to a show, it goes without saying that a trip to the groomers for a bath is in order. How to wash your cat – the dos and don’ts The average indoor cat may never need a bath, but if you do decide to take the plunge, we do not recommend bathing your kitty more than a couple of times a year. Only you know your cat’s personality and levels of aggression, which can be a key deciding factor when it comes to bathing a cat. Cats that have been bathed regularly since they were kittens are the most likely to tolerate being bathed as an adult cat. A scared cat can hiss, spit and become hostile, so you need to consider whether it is worth the stress (for you and your kitty) to bathe your cat, unless they are extremely dirty.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d3", "source_url": "https://www.purina.com/articles/cat/care/do-cats-need-baths", "snippet": "Do Cats Ever Need Baths? | Purina Do Cats Ever Need Baths? Generally, cats do not need baths. After all, grooming themselves is something cats do often and well. In addition, with their barbed tongues, they are usually capable of keeping their own coats clean without any help from their humans. That said, even indoors, your cat can encounter dirt or debris, whether from their litter box, food or drink spills and other messes. So, if you find yourself asking, “Should I bathe my cat?” the answer is: it depends. Hairless cats with no fur to absorb sebum (the oily substance produced by the body to protect and moisturize the skin) If a member of your household is allergic to cats, you may be tempted to bathe your cat more often to reduce dander. Purina’s researchers have found that dander isn’t the cause of allergies, though. A protein found in cats’ saliva is the primary cat allergen, which gets transferred to the fur and skin during grooming and is then shed into the environment. Human allergists may advise you to bathe your cat in order to decrease the allergen. Because a good percentage of cats might not tolerate that, you could consider feeding your cat LiveClear cat food, which has been shown to reduce the allergen. How Often Should You Bathe a Cat? There’s no set frequency for giving a cat a bath. Cats with long hair, like Persians, may need more frequent grooming to help keep their coats shiny, clean and free of tangles and mats. Short-haired cats may only need weekly brushing and the occasional bath when they get dirty. You can also consult your veterinarian or a professional cat groomer on how often to bathe your cat. They can tell you based on your cat’s breed, skin and coat health and other issues whether their own grooming is sufficient or if/when a bath is needed, and which cat shampoo is right for your cat. When done properly, a bath can be beneficial for your cat’s skin and coat.

When You Should—And Shouldn’t—Give Your Cat A Bath Bath time is usually a stressful occasion for both pets and their owners, leading many to wonder—is bathing cats really necessary? To the relief of many a cat owner, the answer is typically “no,” according to Dr. Alison Diesel, a clinical associate professor at the Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences. “In general, cats do not need to be given a bath by their owners,” she said. “Their fastidious grooming behavior makes this a non-necessary task, which most owners are quite thankful for.” Some cats may not groom themselves appropriately because of obesity, arthritis, or an underlying medical condition. If an owner notices any change in their cat’s normal grooming behavior, a veterinarian can help determine the cause. But even if these kitties need some help getting clean, a true bath is usually not necessary unless the cat is especially dirty. “A good brushing may be sufficient unless there are fecal/urinary incontinence concerns,” Diesel said. “I rarely recommend bathing for my feline patients. There are certain topical products that I may consider for cats, like a leave-on antiseptic mousse if they have a skin infection, but a true bath is typically not recommended or indicated.” For many medical conditions, from fungal infections to allergies, a bath with a medicated shampoo can be a treatment option, but Diesel said owners should be confident in their ability to safely bathe their pet first. Beyond cats’ ability to clean themselves, Diesel usually recommends not bathing cats because of the damages it can cause to a cat-owner relationship. “The act of bathing cats can cause behavioral trauma, which may affect the human-animal bond if this is not something the cat is used to,” she said. “For an adult cat that has not had a bath previously, the experience can be quite traumatic. They may lash out, bite, and scratch; this obviously introduces safety concerns for the owners.”", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d5", "source_url": "https://www.preventivevet.com/cats/giving-a-cat-a-bath-why-and-how", "snippet": "Bath Time! Why and How You Should Bathe Your Cat | Preventive Vet Cats don't need us to bathe them. They're experts in staying clean. In fact, fur covered in water can feel dirty to a cat. It's a foreign substance they don't want on their coat. They do a great job keeping themselves clean. But there are times when your cat may need a traditional bath. Mobility: Senior cats (8+ years old) are prone to joint pain, arthritis, and other issues limiting their mobility. If your cat isn't physically able to reach part of their body, they may need your help with bathing. Safety/Emergency: A bath is a must if your cat gets into something they shouldn't ingest. Chemicals, oils, and even the pollen of true lilies can be dangerous if your cat licks them off. If you've put your dog's flea control product on your cat, you will definitely need to bathe them, as pyrethroids are extremely toxic to cats. You should be seeking veterinary help as well. Long coat care: Long-haired breeds may need baths to keep their coat free of painful mats — though daily brushing can go a long way to cut back on that need, as well as sanitary area trims. Lack of energy: If your cat is lethargic from age or medical issues, bathing themselves may not be high on their priority list. Wound care: If your cat has been injured, your veterinarian may recommend bathing as part of wound care. In this case, it's vitally important that you follow their instructions to the letter. Skin conditions: Cats with allergies, fleas, ringworm, or other skin conditions may need special or medicated baths for treatment. Again, following your veterinarian's instructions is key. Weight: Similar to cats with arthritis, overweight cats can't always reach every spot of their body to properly clean themselves. Getting Your Cat Comfortable with Baths Some cats enjoy water.

Most cats feel anxious and stressed by baths because they dislike water. If you do need to bathe your cat, it’s essential to follow our advice regarding how to wash your cat safely and with minimal stress. By safely, we mean without hurting your cat and without getting scratched yourself! How do I teach my cat to like a bath? The goal is to teach your cat that being in water with your supervision is safe and even enjoyable. Give your cat a treat – whether it’s food or a favorite toy – every time they are bathed so they begin to associate the activity with the desirable thing more than they associate it with fear or discomfort. Be patient and gradually desensitize your pet to bathing over many weeks. If you find out your cat has a medical condition which means they’ll need regular baths, you can take your time to get your training right. If your cat has gone out and got mucky, you may have to do a one-off bath more urgently, but you can still follow these steps to make the bath as low-stress as possible. Introducing your cat to water If your cat is used to grooming, then introducing water is not a huge step from this. We recommend all cats are groomed regularly with a brush – weekly for short-haired cats and daily for long-haired cats. This is a great way to bond with your cat. Injured, arthritic, or overweight cats might struggle to groom themselves without your help, so it’s good to help them get used to grooming early on.

Here are just some of the topics discussed: Should I bathe my cat? There isn't much need to bathe a cat. They often will keep themselves clean and tidy, but occasionally they may need help with grooming by brushing them, especially if longhaired (longhaired cats should be brushed daily). Bathing can strip the coat of essential oils which are needed to promote skin health and add a layer of waterproofing. Also if you are using topical flea control products, you might risk removing these during bathing. Why does my cat scratch the floor around her bowl after she's finished eating? Cats can do this as a way of disguising what they view as 'uneaten prey'. In the wild, any uneaten food could draw the attention of bigger predators or other cats that could pose a threat, so cats may feel this instinct kicking in and want to hide uneaten food. My cat has a hanging ‘pouch’ of very loose skin under her belly, in front of her hind legs. Is that normal? I read that it's normal, especially in spayed cats, and more pronounced as they get older, but wanted to make sure before I take her to the vet for nothing (very stressful for her!). Many cats develop a ‘dewlap’ – a hanging apron of skin on their belly. It is a place for fat storage and is a normal feature. As you describe it, I'd say this was nothing to worry about but keep an eye on her weight, especially as she gets older and less active. What is the best way to reduce the risk of gingivitis and plaque build-up? We adopted our cat as a stray when she was around three years old and she had many teeth removed due to plaque.

Because your cat is constantly grooming herself, you don’t want her to ingest anything that’s on her fur that could make her ill, such as a household cleaner, paint, human body products or anything else that isn’t safe for consumption. How to introduce your cat to the bath If you find yourself in a situation where giving your cat a bath is necessary, then it’s important to start the process slowly. Dr. Coates recommends first introducing your cat to a warm, damp cloth rather than trying to put her directly in water. Continue to dampen the towel more and more until your cat’s ready to be introduced to a running tap. Start washing her legs with cat shampoo and move up the body from there, being sure to avoid your cat’s face. Reward her with treats during and after, and give her plenty of time to groom and dry herself after the bath’s over. Dangers of over-bathing your cat Because most cats aren’t used to water and being bathed, bathing a cat too often could have some harmful effects. Your cat could develop dry skin. “Bathing too frequently can dry the skin, so healthy cats shouldn’t be bathed more frequently than every four to six weeks or so,” Dr. Coates said. Rather than stripping oils out of your cat’s skin with shampoo and water, brushing her can actually stimulate natural oil production, which nourishes both her skin and coat. You could cause emotional trauma. If your cat has had a prior negative experience with water — even an experience that happened before you got your cat, such as falling into a body of water as a kitten — giving her frequent baths could be deepening her trauma and dissolving her trust in you. Rather than giving your cat a full bath after something minor, like a litter box mishap or her flicking her tail through something gross, Dr. Coates recommends using pet wipes for a quick clean.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d9", "source_url": "https://www.zoetispetcare.com/blog/article/do-need-bathe-cat", "snippet": "Do I Need to Bathe My Cat? | Zoetis Petcare Do I Need to Bathe My Cat?

Do Cats Really Need Baths? In most cases, no, you really don't need to give your cat a bath. Cats do an extremely good job of keeping themselves clean and their coat and skin benefit from natural oils you don't want to wash away. However, there are times when it may be helpful or even necessary to bathe your cat. As cats get older, or if they have physical limitations, they may be less able to self-groom. Some longhair breeds may need bathing to keep fur from matting, like Persians, Himalayans, and Ragdolls. Cats with specific skin conditions may need baths to soothe or treat the skin. If your cat gets into something they shouldn't ingest, you'll want to bathe them for safety reasons to remove any residue from their coats. If your cat picks up bugs in their fur (like fleas, ticks, mites, or lice) bathing — and medical treatment — may help prevent irritation, infection, and disease. There may be litter box incidents or other messy situations that need a little clean-up. Even if your cat needs a bath, it's important to remember that a cat's scent is extremely important. Bathing not only diminishes it but may even cloud it with the scent of the bath products you use (which can be stressful for your cat).

Can I use baby shampoo? No. Cats should only be bathed with a shampoo formulated for use on cats - their skin has a different thickness and pH (acidity) than human skin.

According to veterinarians, cats can actually be very good at keeping themselves clean. They do this by licking themselves using their rough tongues to remove fur clumps and foreign objects. Meanwhile, their saliva naturally spreads protective oils over their coat and skin to help them maintain their glossy coat.1 In fact, a bath may not be necessary very often, if at all, if you:1 Combine a cat’s self-care with brushing and regular grooming to remove tangles or matted hair.

Here’s what you need to know about when to bathe your cat and how to prevent bath time problems. Benefits of Bathing Your Cat The most obvious benefit of bathing your cat is that it will get them clean. This is especially important if your cat has come into contact with something oily, greasy, or dirty. Cats can get themselves into some messy predicaments, and a good bath can help get them back to looking and smelling their best. Aside from general cleanliness, there are several benefits to bathing your cat. First, bathing stimulates your cat’s skin and encourages the removal of excess oil, dander, and dead hair. One of the biggest downfalls of being a pet parent is the shedding of pet hair that always finds its way onto your clothing and furniture. Bathing your cat is an essential way to help minimize this issue. Another benefit of bathing your cat is that it promotes comfort with being handled. Some cats are quite independent, and dislike being touched. This can cause problems when it’s time for vet visits or grooming appointments. Bathing is a good way to increase your cat’s ease with being handled, allowing them to become more accustomed to touch. Finally, bathing can help address medical concerns such as allergies, infections, and parasites. If you suspect that your cat may be suffering from any of these issues, a trip to the veterinarian is in order. However, if your vet does recommend bathing your cat as part of their treatment plan, it’s important to follow their instructions carefully and only use recommended products. How Often Should You Bathe Your Cat? The guideline for how often your cat should be bathed is similar to that of dogs: approximately every 4 – 6 weeks.

The Longest Wars Ever To Be Fought In Human History Conflict and war have been brutal facts of life in human history. Throughout the ages, the world has seen battles between nations that have changed the course of history and drawn-out conflicts that linger long after their combatants have passed away. The following records examine some of the longest wars and conflicts in recorded history, whose legacies still echo through time on both a global and personal level. To understand contemporary tensions, one must explore who initiated these historical conflicts, why they started, the effects, and perhaps most notably, when these centuries-old struggles finally ended. After all, future generations cannot quench the violent potential of humanity without intentional self-education. Reconquista - 781 Years The Capitulation of Granada, 1492. Spanning an incredible 781 years, the Reconquista was a long and arduous war fought by Spanish and Portuguese forces against the Muslim rulers of the Iberian Peninsula. The conflict began around 711 CE when an Islamic-Berber army crossed the Straight of Gibraltar. These invaders entered Spain and Portugal, and by 718 CE, the Moors controlled much of Iberia. Christian Kingdoms fell to the prowess of the Cordoban Caliphate until the caliph disintegrated in the 11th century. After that point, Christian kingdoms slowly resurged and grew to dominate the peninsula. Though there were a series of defeats and victories on both sides throughout these centuries, eventually, in 1492 CE, Granada in present-day southern Andalusia finally fell to Ferdinand II and Isabella I. That defeat marked the end of one of the longest-recorded wars and ushered in a new era of Catholic Christianity for Iberia as it entered the Renaissance.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. America’s Longest War When U.S. troops leave Afghanistan by September 11, 2021, the American war will have lasted nearly two decades and spanned four presidencies. The longest war in U.S. history has come at the financial cost of close to $1 trillion. It has killed more than 2,000 American soldiers and, according to some estimates, hundreds of thousands of Afghans. The United States invaded Afghanistan on October 7, 2001. President George W. Bush authorized the war in response to 9/11—Taliban-ruled Afghanistan was providing refuge for al Qaeda, the terrorist organization that had orchestrated the attacks. Al Qaeda’s leader, Osama bin Laden, evaded the U.S. military for a decade, but the Taliban regime fell within weeks. U.S. and allied forces stayed in Afghanistan to support a new government in Kabul. But the Taliban soon regrouped. For years, the fighting ebbed and surged as Washington tossed around versions of the same questions: With more time and resources, could the U.S. military finally rout the Taliban and the terrorists they had harbored? Was staying the course a better option than risking the collapse of the fledgling Afghan state? Or was it necessary to find a way out, whether by negotiation or unilateral withdrawal? Over the past two decades, senior officials—including U.S. ambassadors, commanders of U.S. and NATO military forces, and the current president of Afghanistan—as well as leading scholars and journalists have assessed the progress of the war and the prospects of its resolution in the pages of Foreign Affairs. Their essays in this collection trace the conflict from the initial invasion to the 2009 surge, the bloody stalemate, and the decision to withdraw.

The 20 Longest Wars in History It is coming up on two years since the United States finally fully exited the battlefield in Afghanistan — a decade after the war started in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. The war is one of the longest in American history, roughly double the time the nation spent in both of the world wars combined. But in the context of world history, there are wars that dwarf the conflict. (Also check out: The 35 billion-dollar weapons in the U.S. Military budget.) Some wars are quick, especially for countries who spend a lot on their military. But this is not always the case. Before technology made it possible to kill many enemies from anywhere, opposing sides could retreat, take refuge in a fortified castle, and wait to go back out and fight. This allowed some wars in the past to drag out decades and even centuries. 24/7 Wall St. has compiled a list of the longest wars in history by reviewing data and articles from various sources. In order to appear on this list, a conflict had to meet the definition of war as an open and usually declared armed conflict between political entities such as sovereign states or competing factions within the same state, such as a civil war. The conflict had to be sustained over a period of time and intended to resolve political or territorial disputes. In the early 18th century, Sweden was the dominant power in the Baltic region. Three neighboring kingdoms — Russia, Denmark-Norway, and Saxony-Poland — formed a coalition to attack Sweden. They attacked after King Charles XI died and his 14-year-old son Charles XII was crowned. As the war continued, England and Prussia also joined the Russian coalition, sensing an opportunity to gain more land and resources. Finally, after more than two decades of fighting, Sweden surrendered and forfeited much of its territory and wealth to its opponents. This event helped turn Russia into the world power it is today and damaged Sweden’s influence on the world stage. The Peloponnesian War was a conflict between Greek city states — one side led by Athens and the other by Sparta.

Hi Sherry, I hear you, sometimes it feels like the “100% organic natural and pure” ideology is the only way out, but we should be diligent about how we are manifesting that ideology in the world and ask the question: “is it working?” because if it’s not then indeed we will be blindly arguing on our way out. (Especially when the arguing continues to be heavily subsidized towards the unhealthy legacy that paying “experts” to argue has largely given US / and the world in general). While ecological systems are complex it’s not rocket science, it’s pretty obvious what we as people are doing to harm ourselves and ecology in general Yes!! We have to love our planet. Our planet provides everything we need to survive. It’s long overdue that we give back to her, if she dies, we surely will. Reply Charles Rattenberg 3 years ago It’s amazing that the mountain of data that exists doesn’t influence more people on this subject. Organic production got its beginnings with an aim to protect the environment. What followed was a belief that the foods produced were better and/or healthier but there was little or no evidence to support this. There are a number of myths regarding organics, a few of which are: NO PESTICIDES ARE USED. This is false. Period. The NOP lists a chemical inventory of pesticides that are allowed in organic farming. It’s ironic that some of the most commonly used insecticides used in organic fruit and vegetable production are copper sulfates. These are less toxic than conventional insecticides, so farmers use more to control pests.

(Related: Organic Foods Provide More than Health Benefits.) Benefits of organic food Organic is the term used to define the method agricultural products are grown and processed. In the U.S., organic produce must be grown without using synthetic pesticides, bio-engineered genes, petroleum-based fertilizers, and sewage sludge-based fertilizers. For organic livestock raised for meat, eggs, and dairy products, they must have access to the outdoors and be given organic fee, while antibiotics, growth hormones, or any animal byproducts must not be given to them. Organic food is fresher Organic food is also often fresher because it does not contain preservatives that prolongs its shelf life. Organic farming is better for environmental health Organic farming is better for the environment because its practices involve less pollution soil erosion, and energy. Eliminating the use of pesticides in farming also benefits nearby birds and animals and people who live close to farms. Organic food is GMO-free Genetically modified organisms (GMO) or genetically engineered (GE) foods are plants whose DNA were altered in ways that do not occur in nature or in traditional crossbreeding. Organics don’t inhibit the growth of super strains Nature always adapts. Spraying chemicals to kill bugs only makes them grow, adapt to overcome the horrible toxins we use to kill them. There will always be something that eats the plant, and it will continue to grow and adapt until we no longer have control over it.

What are the environmental benefits of organic agriculture? Sustainability over the long term. Many changes observed in the environment are long term, occurring slowly over time. Organic agriculture considers the medium- and long-term effect of agricultural interventions on the agro-ecosystem. It aims to produce food while establishing an ecological balance to prevent soil fertility or pest problems. Organic agriculture takes a proactive approach as opposed to treating problems after they emerge. Soil. Soil building practices such as crop rotations, inter-cropping, symbiotic associations, cover crops, organic fertilizers and minimum tillage are central to organic practices. These encourage soil fauna and flora, improving soil formation and structure and creating more stable systems. In turn, nutrient and energy cycling is increased and the retentive abilities of the soil for nutrients and water are enhanced, compensating for the non-use of mineral fertilizers. Such management techniques also play an important role in soil erosion control. The length of time that the soil is exposed to erosive forces is decreased, soil biodiversity is increased, and nutrient losses are reduced, helping to maintain and enhance soil productivity. Crop export of nutrients is usually compensated by farm-derived renewable resources but it is sometimes necessary to supplement organic soils with potassium, phosphate, calcium, magnesium and trace elements from external sources. Water. In many agriculture areas, pollution of groundwater courses with synthetic fertilizers and pesticides is a major problem. As the use of these is prohibited in organic agriculture, they are replaced by organic fertilizers (e.g. compost, animal manure, green manure) and through the use of greater biodiversity (in terms of species cultivated and permanent vegetation), enhancing soil structure and water infiltration. Well managed organic systems with better nutrient retentive abilities, greatly reduce the risk of groundwater pollution. In some areas where pollution is a real problem, conversion to organic agriculture is highly encouraged as a restorative measure (e.g. by the Governments of France and Germany).

Organic produce contains fewer pesticides. Chemicals such as synthetic fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides are widely used in conventional agriculture and residues remain on (and in) the food we eat. Organic food is often fresher because it doesn't contain preservatives that make it last longer. Organic produce is sometimes (but not always, so watch where it is from) produced on smaller farms nearer to where it is sold. Organic farming tends to be better for the environment. Organic farming practices may reduce pollution, conserve water, reduce soil erosion, increase soil fertility, and use less energy. Farming without synthetic pesticides is also better for nearby birds and animals as well as people who live close to farms. Organically raised animals are NOT given antibiotics, growth hormones, or fed animal byproducts. Feeding livestock animal byproducts increases the risk of mad cow disease (BSE) and the use of antibiotics can create antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Organically-raised animals tend to be given more space to move around and access to the outdoors, which helps to keep them healthy. Organic meat and milk can be richer in certain nutrients. Results of a 2016 European study show that levels of certain nutrients, including omega-3 fatty acids, were up to 50 percent higher in organic meat and milk than in conventionally raised versions.

This leads us to three key conclusions in the organic-conventional farming debate: The common perception that organic food is by default better, or is an ideal way to reduce environmental impact is a clear misconception. Across several metrics, organic agriculture actually proves to be more harmful for the world’s environment than conventional agriculture. The debate between organic and intensive agriculture advocates is often needlessly polarized. There are scenarios where one system proves better than the other, and vice versa. If I were to advise on where and when to choose one or the other, I’d advise trying to choose organic pulses and fruits, but sticking with non-organic for all other food products (cereals, vegetables, dairy and eggs, and meat). The organic-conventional debate often detracts from other aspects of dietary choices which have greater impact. If looking to reduce the environmental impact of your diet, what you eat can be much more influential than how it is produced. The relative difference in land use and greenhouse gas impacts between organic and conventional systems is typically less than a multiple of two. Compare this to the relative differences in impacts between food types where, as shown in the charts below, the difference in land use and greenhouse gas emissions per unit protein between high-impact meats and low-impact crop types can be more than 100-fold. If your primary concern is whether the potato accompanying your steak is conventionally or organically produced, then your focus is arguably misplaced from the decisions which could have the greatest impact. A note on health and food safety with regards to organic and conventional produce From a health point-of-view, many consumers consider organic food to be safer due to lower exposure to pesticides.16 Is organic food healthier and safer in this regard?

It is estimated that more than 6 out of every 10 Australian households now buy organic foods on occasion. Popular products include fruit and vegetables, beef, non-alcoholic drinks, nuts and ready to eat foods. Reasons to buy organic food Most people buy organically-grown food products because they are concerned about pesticides, additives, antibiotics or other chemical residues, and believe organic food is healthier. Other reasons include – concerns with the impact of conventional farming on biodiversity and the environment, and the ethical treatment of livestock. Organic food and nutrition content Several studies have compared the nutritional content of organic and conventionally grown plants, and most have shown no significant differences in key vitamin and mineral content. Although the differences are small – research has shown that some organic food has: lower nitrate levels higher vitamin C levels higher levels of some minerals (such as phosphorous, magnesium and iron). Organic food and ethics Organic foods promote more humane treatment of animals, as well as providing meat that is free from hormones and antibiotics. Also, some people worry about the long-term health, economic and environmental consequences of GM foods and choose organic foods in support of an industry that does not use GM techniques. Organic food is better for the environment Organic foods promote healthier and more sustainable use of natural resources. Modern conventional farming methods include excessive use of chemicals and planting only one crop multiple times (monocropping). This has led to a decline in soil fertility, and an increase in salinity and blue-green algae in waterways over many years.

Science-Backed Health Benefits of Eating Organic The organic food industry is growing at a rapid rate, and the future is looking extremely bright in terms of business in this industry. Most consumers are looking to buy organic, since it is not only better for the environment, but also because of various health-related reasons. There have been numerous studies done that have shown that organic food is healthier and better than conventionally grown food. We have covered some science-backed health benefits of eating organic foods here, along with the benefits that you will gain by making them a part of your diet every day. 1. More healthy fats Eating organic products like milk and meat means that you have 50% more omega-3 fatty acids than if you consumed conventionally produced products. This was concluded in a study done in 2016 in the British Journal of Nutrition. The study tested organic milk and found that it had less saturated fat than non-organic milk. This is mainly down to differences in how organic livestock are raised, since a grass-fed diet and spending more time outdoors resulted in healthier milk and meat. 2.

The European Union plans to reach organic production on 25 percent of its agricultural land by 2030, up from 9.1 percent in 2020. The United States, in contrast, isn’t putting big bets on organic, which still represents less than 1 percent of total American farmland. Instead, the USDA promotes climate-smart agriculture by investing $1 billion in regenerative commodity pilot projects. But which is the better move? Organic requires too much land Organic farming isn’t more climate-friendly than conventional agriculture when looking strictly at emissions. In a comparative analysis of the environmental impacts of different agricultural production systems, Michael Clark and David Tilman at the University of Minnesota found that “organic and conventional systems did not significantly differ in their greenhouse gas emissions.” But that’s not all that matters. Land use is organic’s achilles heel. The analysis concluded that organic farms require 25 to 110 percent more land to produce the same amount of food than conventional systems because organic yields are lower. That’s terrible news for the climate because land use comes with a so-called “carbon opportunity cost.” When not used for farming, the same land could host natural ecosystems such as forests and grasslands that store much larger amounts of carbon than agricultural soils. But agriculture keeps taking over more and more natural ecosystems instead of returning fields to nature, thus continuing to fuel the climate and biodiversity crises. The resulting need to limit agriculture’s land use — alongside profitability concerns — keeps many farmers and environmentalists laser-focused on securing high yields. Advances in breeding, pesticides and fertilizers, machinery and farm analytics have led to an impressive yield increase over the past decades.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d10", "source_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/09/10/is-organic-food-worth-the-expense/organic-food-is-for-the-wealthy-not-the-poor", "snippet": "Organic Food Is for the Wealthy, Not the Poor - NYTimes.com The Stanford study showed what most academics already knew: there are few if any health benefits of organic foods. In reaction, many critics of the study emphasized their lower pesticide content, and general environmental benefits. But these points conceal much larger drawbacks. Avoiding well-regulated pesticides can do some good -- based on my calculations using U.S. Food and Drug Administration estimates, it might avoid up to 20 cancer deaths per year in the United States. But organic food also costs 10 percent to 174 percent more for fruits, vegetables and meat. As I point out in my book, \"The Skeptical Environmentalist,\" a decrease of just 10 percent in fruit and vegetable consumption in the U.S. because of higher prices would cause an increase in cancer of about 4.6 percent of the total number of cancers, or some 26,000 additional cancer deaths annually. The Stanford study emphasizes the importance of eating fruits and vegetables “however they are grown,” but the scale is missing. Eating more fruits and vegetables is incredibly more important than avoiding already well-regulated pesticides. In fact, it can be argued that if the higher costs mean you reduce your intake of fruits and vegetables by just one-thousandth of an ounce a day (equivalent of half a grain of rice), your total risk of cancer goes up, not down. Based on my calculations using World Cancer Research Fund data: omit buying just one apple every 20 years because you have gone organic, and you’re worse off. Organic advocates often claim that its methods lead to less nitrogen pollution, but calculated per good produced, that pollution is similar to or higher than conventional methods. And most important, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that shifting U.S. agricultural production to organic would require an area greater than the state of California to be converted from pristine land into agriculture.

Rosen, emeritus professor of food toxicology at Rutgers, puts it even more strongly. \"Any consumers who buy organic food because they believe that it contains more healthful nutrients than conventional food are wasting their money,\" he writes in a comprehensive review of organic nutritional claims13. Strong organic proponents also argue that organic food tastes better. In the same poll where 95% of UK organic consumers said they buy organic to avoid pesticides, over two-thirds of respondents said organic produce and meats taste better than non-organic ones. But when researchers had people put their mouths to the test, they found that people couldn't tell the difference between the two in blind taste tests14, 18. So, in short, organics are not better for us and we can't tell the difference between them and non-organic foods. There may be many things that are good about organic farming, from increased biodiversity on farms to movement away from monocultures, but producing foods that are healthier and tastier simply isn't one of them.

Image REM sleep first occurs about 90 minutes after falling asleep. Your eyes move rapidly from side to side behind closed eyelids. Mixed frequency brain wave activity becomes closer to that seen in wakefulness. Your breathing becomes faster and irregular, and your heart rate and blood pressure increase to near waking levels. Most of your dreaming occurs during REM sleep, although some can also occur in non-REM sleep. Your arm and leg muscles become temporarily paralyzed, which prevents you from acting out your dreams. As you age, you sleep less of your time in REM sleep. Memory consolidation most likely requires both non-REM and REM sleep. Sleep Mechanisms Two internal biological mechanisms–circadian rhythm and homeostasis–work together to regulate when you are awake and sleep. Circadian rhythms direct a wide variety of functions from daily fluctuations in wakefulness to body temperature, metabolism, and the release of hormones. They control your timing of sleep and cause you to be sleepy at night and your tendency to wake in the morning without an alarm. Your body’s biological clock, which is based on a roughly 24-hour day, controls most circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms synchronize with environmental cues (light, temperature) about the actual time of day, but they continue even in the absence of cues. Image Your body's biological clock is based on a 24-hour day and controls most circadian rhythms. These rhythms affect a variety of functions including body temperature (represented as the white line on the chart above). Melatonin - a hormone released by the pineal gland - helps you feel sleepy once the lights go down. The peaks and valleys of melatonin (represented as the gold line above) are important for matching the body's circadian rhythm to the external cycle of light and darkness.

Dreams, which are more vivid in REM sleep, may be involved in emotional processing. Also, your amygdala, the part of your brain that processes emotions, activates during REM sleep.

Adding to the evidence is that animals born with less developed brains, such as humans and puppies, spend even more time in REM sleep during infancy than those that are born with more developed brains, like horses and birds. Wakefulness Preparation: REM sleep, through its activation of our central nervous system, might help us get ready to wake back up. This may explain why we spend increasing amounts of time in REM sleep as the night progresses and why we are easier to wake up during this stage. How Much REM Sleep Do You Need? We need the most REM sleep as infants and children, when our brains are still developing. Newborn babies spend eight hours in REM sleep each day. By adulthood, we only need an average of two hours of REM sleep each night. Different species require different amounts of REM sleep.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d3", "source_url": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/08/160809121817.htm", "snippet": "Dreaming also occurs during non rapid eye movement sleep ... Researchers from Aalto University and the University of Wisconsin utilised a TMS-EEG device, which combines transcranial magnetic stimulation and EEG, to examine how the brain activity of people in the restful non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is affected by whether they dream or do not dream. When the NREM sleep of subjects had lasted at least three minutes, researchers gave magnetic pulses that induced a weak electric field and activated neurons. After a series of pulses, the subject was woken with an alarm sound, and they were then asked whether they had dreamed and to describe the content of the dream. 'It is traditionally thought that dreaming occurs only in REM sleep. However, as also our study demonstrates, subjects woken from NREM sleep are also able to give accounts of their dreams in more than half of cases,' Post-doctoral Researcher Jaakko Nieminen from Aalto University explains. 'EEG showed that the deterministic brain activity produced by magnetic pulses was notably shorter in people who did not dream, i.e. were unconscious, than in people who had dreamt. We also observed that the longer the story about the dream, the more the subject's EEG resembled that measured from people who were awake,' Dr Nieminen explains. Assessment of consciousness may help in treatment of brain injury patients Dr Nieminen performed the measurements with his research colleague Olivia Gosseries at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Center for Sleep and Consciousness, which is headed by Giulio Tononi. The measurements were carried out during a period of over 40 nights and a total of 11 subjects participated. Due to sleeping difficulties and other challenges, reliable measurements could only be acquired from six subjects. During the night, subjects were woken a maximum of 16 times. 'Consciousness in different physiological states (e.g. during wakefulness, sleep, anesthesia and vegetative state) has previously been researched with TMS-EEG measurements. We wanted to eliminate all other differences related to the different states as thoroughly as possible, and for this reason we focused on the narrow physiological state of NREM sleep,' Dr Nieminen notes.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d4", "source_url": "https://www.healthline.com/health/sleep/dream-cycle", "snippet": "Dream Cycle: Sleep Stages, REM vs. NREM, Changing Your Dreams Curious about what goes on in your brain when it’s out to dreamland? We can’t blame you. Experts still have plenty to learn about sleep, but they do know it happens in a cycle, with different things occurring at different stages. Though you might sometimes wake up feeling as if you dreamed all night long, you don’t necessarily dream during every stage of sleep. Rather, dreams seem to happen mostly during the REM stage of sleep. Keep reading to explore how and when your dreams float in while you’re fast asleep. During REM sleep, which generally begins about an hour to 90 minutes after you fall asleep, you’ll dream — though you may not remember those dreams. Both types of sleep are important. While experts used to believe REM sleep played the most important role in learning and memory processes, they now consider NREM sleep even more important for these functions. Plus, the most restful phase of sleep also happens during NREM sleep. Experts aren’t entirely certain, but they do know people typically spend somewhere around 2 hours dreaming every night. You probably won’t remember every single one of those dreams, though. If someone wakes you up during REM sleep, you might know you were just dreaming, perhaps vividly. When someone wakes you up during NREM sleep, on the other hand, you’re far less likely to feel as if you were just dreaming. Can you ever dream during non-REM sleep? Dreams can happen during any stage of sleep, but the vivid ones that you remember tend to happen during REM sleep. A small 2016 study used something called a TMS-EEG — a device that combines transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and an electroencephalogram (EEG) test to look at brain activity — to explore whether people waking from restful NREM sleep reported dreams. Over half the participants reported having dreams when woken from NREM sleep.

Now, a recent study suggests that one particular type of sleep may be especially important when it comes to how the brain responds to stressful situations. The research, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, found that people who spent more time in rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep — the phase when dreaming occurs — had lower fear-related brain activity when they were given mild electric shocks the next day. The findings suggest that getting sufficient REM sleep prior to fearful experiences may make a person less prone to developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the authors hypothesize. The study isn’t the first to suggest that REM sleep delivers unique benefits. Some experts even believe that it’s actually a lack of REM sleep and a lack of dreaming — rather than just poor sleep in general — that’s responsible for many of the health problems Americans suffer from today. Here’s what scientists know so far — and what they suspect — about REM sleep, dreams and what happens when people are deprived of both. What happens during REM sleep? Sleep involves five distinct phases, which the brain and body cycle through several times during the night. The first four phases involve a transition from shallow to deep sleep, while the fifth phase, REM sleep, involves heightened brain activity and vivid dreams. REM sleep stages tend to be relatively short during the first two-thirds of the night as the body prioritizes deeper, slow-wave sleep. And because longer periods of REM sleep only happen during the final hours of sleep (in the early morning, for most people), it can get cut off when you don’t spend a full seven or eight hours in bed, says psychologist Rubin Naiman, a sleep and dream specialist at the University of Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine and the author of a recent review about dreaming published in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d6", "source_url": "https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2000/0401/p2037.html", "snippet": "Nightmares and Disorders of Dreaming | AAFP ) stages. REM sleep occurs cyclically every 90 minutes during the night in association with high brain activity, rapid spontaneous eye movements and suppressed voluntary motor activity. Dreaming occurs in all stages of sleep. It is reported by 80 percent of persons who are awakened during REM sleep and sleep onset (stages 1 and 2), and 40 percent of persons who are awakened from a deep sleep. Patient reports about the content of their dreams vary based on the sleep stage from which they are awakened. Patient reports of dreams experienced during REM sleep tend to be bizarre and detailed, with storyline plot associations. In contrast, dreams experienced in deep sleep are more diffuse (e.g., dreams about a color or an emotion). The dreams of stages 1 and 2 are simpler, shorter and have fewer associations than the dreams of REM sleep. The ability to recall dreams may reflect the dream's accessibility or distance from awake thought; the highest recall seems to occur during sleep stages with electroencephalographic patterns that are most like those in the waking state.1 Some researchers believe that dreams have no function. Others think that dreams are the nocturnal continuation of conscious thought processing during the day or a reprogramming of the central nervous system for the next day's conscious functioning.2 Evidence suggests that dreaming, like most other physiologic events, is important for learning and memory processing, gives cognitive feedback about a person's mental functioning and helps a person adapt to emotional and physical stress.3 Frightening Dreams: The Nightmare Nightmares are vivid and terrifying nocturnal episodes in which the dreamer is abruptly awakened from sleep.

An acquisition is when one company takes over another – either in its entirety, or a majority share thereof. There are two ways to acquire a company: through a hostile takeover or a friendly takeover. A hostile takeover is the term used to describe when a company is bought by another without its consent. Generally, the buying company purchases a majority amount of shares to get a controlling stake in another company. On the other end of the spectrum, there’s a friendly takeover, when both companies agree to the terms of the acquisition. Note that an acquisition and a merger are also two different concepts.

Understanding the largest technology acquisition and merger deals, what worked and what didn’t, can help to inform a successful tech acquisition strategy. What is a technology acquisition? A tech acquisition is when a company acquires (does a deal to buy) a smaller technology company to gain access to technology it owns or has developed to incorporate this tech into its range of products and services to increase market opportunities and amplify its capabilities. A tech acquisition allows the acquiring company to benefit from new technology without undertaking research and development. Both parties may consent to a ‘friendly takeover’ and negotiate the acquisition terms. In a ‘hostile takeover’, the acquiring company buys an entire company or majority shareholding in that company without consent. Tech-based mergers and acquisitions may occur between established companies or in emerging markets and products. Tech acquisitions' role in industry growth Tech acquisitions have a central role in growth in the technology industry. A merger or acquisition may benefit both parties, offering an exit strategy for startup founders or an opportunity for both companies to expand into new markets. Creating synergy For example, software and hardware technologies combine to create a new product or service. Combined companies share resources, including intellectual property (IP), knowledge, and processes and can find cost efficiencies that benefit the outcomes. Improving time to market Resources from each tech company are combined to accelerate research, development and release of a timely and relevant product. An acquisition of a tech start-up or smaller company may benefit the smaller company by bringing innovative technology to market faster, perhaps in industries or applications where a smaller company does not have market entry. Bringing innovation into new industries New technologies are required to solve emerging and modern problems in industries like defence, security and health. Large companies may not pivot quickly from established solutions to find timely answers to new challenges in rapidly evolving markets. Emerging requirements are an opportunity for mid-size and smaller hardware or software companies with capital to acquire the knowledge and technology to provide timely solutions ahead of larger businesses.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d7", "source_url": "https://grata.com/resources/mergers-and-acquisitions-examples", "snippet": "9 of the Biggest Mergers and Acquisitions of All Time - Grata In June 2016, Microsoft announced its acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2B, marking the largest acquisition in Microsoft's history.

In most other constitutional monarchies, the monarch is at least nominal chief executive, while being bound by convention to act on the advice of the cabinet. In contrast, the Constitution of Japan explicitly vests executive power in the Cabinet, of which the prime minister is the leader; this greatly enhances the prime minister's position compared to prime ministers in other parliamentary democracies. His countersignature is required for all laws and Cabinet orders. While most ministers in parliamentary democracies have some freedom of action within the bounds of cabinet collective responsibility, the Japanese Cabinet is effectively an extension of the prime minister's authority.

On top of the bad numbers have been some missteps regarding policy proposals that Ishiba made when he was campaigning. In particular, in an English-language essay on the Hudson Institute's website, Ishiba had outlined several proposals that have garnered an overwhelmingly negative response in both Japan and the United States, including calling for U.S. nuclear sharing with Japan; revising the U.S.-Japan Status of Forces Agreement (which allows American military bases to operate in Japan) to create a more equal relationship; and creating an Asian version of NATO. These ideas have been hammered by Japanese and foreign experts alike. Nuclear sharing has been criticized as one item on his security policy agenda that could “increase regional tensions and threaten national security.” And such a proposal would run counter to the formal Extended Deterrence Dialogue that Japan and the United States have conducted since 2010.

In a show of Japan’s respect to its most important ally, the United States, Ishiba spoke by telephone with President Joe Biden early Wednesday and told reporters he reassured Biden of his plan to further strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance that Biden and Kishida have significantly elevated. His new Cabinet emphasizes defense and a majority of its members, including Ishiba himself, are unaffiliated with factions led and controlled by Liberal Democratic Party heavyweights, and none is from the late Shinzo Abe’s faction that has been linked to damaging misconduct. Speaking to reporters at the prime minister’s office for the first time following a palace ceremony, Ishiba called for stronger military cooperation with like-minded partners. He has been vocal about his wish to form a NATO-like alliance in the region. He said that one of his policy’s main goals was to protect Japan as “the security environment surrounding us is the toughest since the end of World War II.” Ishiba renewed his proposal of a more equal Japan-U.S. security alliance, including joint management of U.S. bases in Japan and having Japanese bases in the United States, which would require changes to a bilateral forces agreement.

New LDP party leader Shigeru Ishiba becomes Japan's prime ministerIshiba, who chosen as the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's new leader on Friday, replaces Fumio Kishida who stepped down after his government was dogged by multiple scandals. Opposition parties criticized Ishiba for allowing only a short period of time for his policies to be examined and discussed in parliament before the national election. Kishida had announced in August he would resign at the end of his three-year term. Kishida and his ministers stepped down at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said. Kishida left his office after a brief send-off ceremony in which he was presented a bouquet of red roses and applauded by his staff and former Cabinet members. “As we face a critical moment in and outside the country, I earnestly hope key policies that will pioneer Japan's future will be powerfully pursued by the new Cabinet,” Kishida said in a statement, citing the need to bolster security amid a deepening global divide, such as Russia's war in Ukraine, while tackling a declining birthrate and population, as well as economic and political reforms at home. Ishiba earlier announced his party's leaders ahead of naming his Cabinet. Former Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, who came in third in the party leadership race, will head the party’s election task force. He is expected to name defense experts Takeshi Iwaya as foreign minister and Gen Nakatani as defense chief. The majority of his Cabinet ministers, like Ishiba, are expected to be unaffiliated with factions led and controlled by party heavyweights, and none are from former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's powerful group linked to damaging scandals. Ishiba's lack of stable power base could also mean a fragility of his government, and “could quickly collapse” even though Ishiba hopes to build up party unity as it prepares for the upcoming election, the liberal-leaning Asahi newspaper said.

Was there something about the Neanderthals’ cognitive capacity that didn’t measure up? Researchers haven’t ever found any soft tissue from Neanderthals. But even in the absence of actual gray matter, researchers can still see something of the Neanderthal brain simply by looking at the skull. The brain and its bony casing grow so closely together that an imprint of the soft tissue can actually be seen on the inside of the skull. The size, shape, and texture imprinted on the surface of this empty space (together creating a real or virtual shape called an endocast), reveals something about the brain once housed inside. Overall, Neanderthal endocasts, and thus their brains, are bigger and of a different shape than those of modern humans. The occipital (rear) portion of the Neanderthal cranium is elongated, resulting in a feature termed the “occipital bun.” Picture a ballerina with her hair tied back at the base of her skull, and you’ll get a rough idea of the shape. Researchers have wondered how that bigger size and odd shape might also affect the size and shape of different regions of the brain, thus influencing patterns of cognition.

Gareth Fuller/Getty Images A 2018 study used CT scans of four adult Neanderthal skulls and four anatomically modern H. sapiens skulls, and MRI scans from more than a thousand living human subjects to create endocasts of their brains.

The researchers speculate that this could be because they evolved exclusively in Europe, which is of higher latitude (and thus has poorer light conditions) than Africa, where H. sapiens evolved. Along with eyes, Neanderthals had significantly larger bodies than humans, with wider shoulders, thicker bones and a more robust build overall. To account for this difference, the researchers drew upon previous research into the estimated body masses of the skeletons found with these skulls and of other Neanderthals. In primates, the amount of brain capacity devoted to body control is also proportionate to body size, so the scientists were able to calculate roughly how much of the Neanderthals’ brains were assigned to this task. After correcting for these differences, the research team found that the amount of brain volume left over for other tasks—in other words, the mental capacity not devoted to seeing the world or moving the body—was significantly smaller for Neanderthals than for ancient H. sapiens. Although the average raw brain volumes of the two groups studied were practically identical (1473.84 cubic centimeters for humans versus 1473.46 for Neanderthals), the average “corrected” Neanderthal brain volume was just 1133.98 cubic centimeters, compared to 1332.41 for the humans. This divergence in mental capacity for higher cognition and social networking, the researcher argue, could have led to the wildly different fates of H. sapiens and Neanderthals. “Having less brain available to manage the social world has profound implications for the Neanderthals’ ability to maintain extended trading networks,” Robin Dunbar, one of the co-authors, said in a press statement. “ are likely also to have resulted in less well developed material culture—which, between them, may have left them more exposed than modern humans when facing the ecological challenges of the Ice Ages.” Previous studies have also suggested that the internal organization of Neanderthal brains differed significantly from ours.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d3", "source_url": "https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/neanderthal-brains-bigger-not-necessarily-better", "snippet": "Neanderthal Brains: Bigger, Not Necessarily Better | Discover ... 520,000 and 630,000 years ago, the shared ancestors of Neanderthals and Homo sapiens diverged and embarked on separate evolutionary paths. Members of that population that spread to Europe eventually evolved into Neanderthals, whereas those in Africa gave rise to Homo sapiens or modern humans. During this period of separation, the groups evolved distinctive anatomies. Modern humans were relatively tall and lean. Neanderthals became short and massive, with average males about 5 foot 4 inches, 170 pounds and females 5 foot 1 inch, 145 pounds, based on estimates from femur and pelvis size. Since their common ancestor, the lineages also increased in brain size, but in different ways. To accommodate bigger brains, Neanderthal crania expanded lengthwise like footballs, whereas modern human skulls became more globular, like soccer balls. By 150,000 years ago, members of both species had brains surpassing 1400 cm3 — about three times larger than chimpanzees, our closest living relatives. How Much Can that Skull Hold To measure fossil brain volume, anthropologists have traditionally filled skulls with beads or seeds, and dumped the contents into a graduated cylinder (a precise measuring cup). They’ve also submerged molds of skulls into water, measuring the volume displaced. Today CT (computed tomography) scanning methods offer more accurate (and less-messy) measurements, but much of the data in textbooks and other references was collected the old fashioned way. Based on these values, we can confidently say fossil Neanderthals and modern humans from the same time period had similar brain sizes.

In effect, the younger Neanderthals (27–75 ka) show no increase in non-somatic/non-visual brain size compared with the older Neanderthals (76–200 ka) and archaic humans. These younger ‘standardized’ Neanderthal endocranial volumes are significantly smaller than those of contemporary AMHs within the 27–75 ka date group (table 2). This suggests that later Neanderthal brains comprised a significantly larger proportion of neural tissue associated with somatic and visual function compared with the brains of contemporary AMHs. 4. Discussion We have demonstrated that Neanderthals had significantly larger orbits than contemporary AMHs, which, owing to scaling between the components of the visual system, suggests that Neanderthal brains contained significantly larger visual cortices. This is corroborated by recent endocast work, which found that Neanderthal occipital lobes are relatively larger than those of AMHs [42]. In addition, previous suggestions that large Neanderthal brains were associated with their high lean body mass [1,43,44] imply that Neanderthal also invested more neural tissue in somatic areas involved in body maintenance and control compared with those of contemporary AMHs. In recent humans (dated to the last approx. 200 years), larger visual systems translate into larger brains [13]. We might therefore expect that larger Neanderthal visual cortices (and somatic areas) would similarly drive overall brain enlargement in this taxon compared with AMHs. However, we have shown that this is not the case for specimens dated 27–75 ka; Neanderthals in this date group do not show significantly larger brains than contemporary AMHs. This suggests that (i) Neanderthal and AMH brains were organized differently, and, (ii) by implication, because a greater proportion of the overall brain tissue in Neanderthals was invested in visual and somatic systems, proportionally less neural tissue was left over for other brain areas in Neanderthals compared with AMHs.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d9", "source_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02895-2", "snippet": "Did this gene give modern human brains their edge?

Credit: Adapted from Alamy More than 500,000 years ago, the ancestors of Neanderthals and modern humans were migrating around the world when a pivotal genetic mutation caused some of their brains to improve suddenly. This mutation, researchers report in Science1, drastically increased the number of brain cells in the hominins that preceded modern humans, probably giving them a cognitive advantage over their Neanderthal cousins. “This is a surprisingly important gene,” says Arnold Kriegstein, a neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco. However, he expects that it will turn out to be one of many genetic tweaks that gave humans an evolutionary advantage over other hominins. “I think it sheds a whole new light on human evolution.” When researchers first reported the sequence of a complete Neanderthal genome in 20142, they identified 96 amino acids — the building blocks that make up proteins — that differ between Neanderthals and modern humans, as well as some other genetic tweaks. Scientists have been studying this list to learn which of these changes helped modern humans to outcompete Neanderthals and other hominins. Cognitive advantage To neuroscientists Anneline Pinson and Wieland Huttner at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden, Germany, one gene stood out.

But if they walked like us, nothing else suggests the first hominins were any more human than chimps or gorillas. Ardipithecus, the earliest well-known hominin, had a brain that was slightly smaller than a chimp's, and there's no evidence they used tools. At this point, Homo erectus appeared. Erectus was taller, more like us in stature, and had large brains – several times bigger than a chimp's brain, and up to two-thirds the size of ours. They made sophisticated tools, like stone handaxes. This was a major technological advance. Handaxes needed skill and planning to create, and you probably had to be taught how to make one. It may have been a metatool – used to fashion other tools, like spears and digging sticks. Like us, Homo erectus had small teeth. That suggests a shift from plant-based diets to eating more meat, probably obtained from hunting. Some of these species were startlingly like us in their skeletons, and their DNA. Homo neanderthalensis, the Neanderthals, had brains approaching ours in size, and evolved even larger brains over time until the last Neanderthals had cranial capacities comparable to a modern human's.

Subjects Abstract Our most recent fossil relatives, the Neanderthals, had a large brain and a very heavy body compared to modern humans. This type of body requires high levels of energetic intake. While food (meat and fat consumption) is a source of energy, oxygen via respiration is also necessary for metabolism. We would therefore expect Neanderthals to have large respiratory capacities. Here we estimate the pulmonary capacities of Neanderthals, based on costal measurements and physiological data from a modern human comparative sample. The Kebara 2 male had a lung volume of about 9.04 l; Tabun C1, a female individual, a lung volume of 5.85 l; and a Neanderthal from the El Sidrón site, a lung volume of 9.03 l. These volumes are approximately 20% greater than the corresponding volumes of modern humans of the same body size and sex. These results show that the Neanderthal body was highly sensitive to energy supply. Introduction Neanderthals are heavy-bodied hominins with relatively short distal limbs and wide trunks1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 consisting of a wide pelvis10,11,12,13 and a wide central–lower thorax14,15,16,17,18,19,20. Therefore, their body shape was characterized as “short but massive”9, with similar proportions to current cold-adapted populations2 but heavier and more muscular. They also showed larger brains than modern humans did in absolute terms, presenting an average cranial capacity of around 1600 cc for males and 1300 cc for females21,22,23,24,25,26.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d12", "source_url": "https://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/bigger-brains-smarter.php", "snippet": "Do Bigger Brains Make Us Smarter? | A Moment of Science ... Noon Edition Do Bigger Brains Make Us Smarter? By Jeremy Shere Posted May 12, 2016 Dear A Moment of Science, do bigger brains make us smarter? I know that primitive humans, like Homo Erectus, had smaller brains than modern humans. But Neanderthals had slightly larger brains than modern humans, and there's no evidence that Neanderthals were smarter than we are. --Big Brained Thinker The short answer is that we don't really know. The Neanderthal example is a good one. Clearly, the raw size and weight of a brain doesn't necessarily translate to significantly greater intelligence. Now, to be clear, there is some evidence that brain size correlates with increased intelligence. But the correlation is pretty weak. According to the latest research, brain size accounts for only between 9Â and 16Â percent of overall variability in human intelligence. But on the other hand, men on average have larger brains than women, and have billions more neurons in parts of the brain that control perception, memory, language, and reasoning. Yet there is no difference between the average IQs of men and women. Plus, some animals, such as elephants and whales, have brains that are much larger than ours. And while it's true that our brainâtoâbody ratio is much greater than elephants or whales, that doesn't solve the puzzle, either. Because shrews and some birds have a greater brainâtoâbody ratio than we do, and it's safe to assume that the average human will beat the average bird on an IQ test any day.

Neanderthal vs. Homo Sapiens Fossil evidence suggests that Neanderthals, like early humans, made an assortment of sophisticated tools from stone and bones. These included small blades, hand axe and scrapers used to remove flesh and fat from animal skin. Neanderthals were skilled hunters who used spears to kill large Ice Age mammals such as mammoths and wooly rhinos. Little is known about Neanderthal culture and customs, though there’s some evidence that Neanderthals might have made symbolic or ornamental objects, created artwork, used fire and intentionally buried their dead. Genetic analysis shows that Neanderthals lived in small, isolated groups that had little contact with each other. Neanderthals had bigger brains than humans, though that doesn’t mean they were smarter. One recent study found that a large portion of the Neanderthal brain was devoted to vision and motor control. This would have come in handy for hunting and coordinating movement of their stocky bodies, yet left relatively little brain space compared to modern humans for areas that controlled thinking and social interactions. Neanderthal DNA Most researchers agree that modern humans and Neanderthals interbred, though many believe that sex between the two species occurred rarely. These matings introduced a small amount of Neanderthal DNA into the human gene pool. Today, most people living outside of Africa have trace amounts of Neanderthal DNA in their genomes. People of European and Asian descent have an estimated 2 percent Neanderthal DNA. Indigenous Africans may have little or no Neanderthal DNA. That’s because the two species did not meet—and mate—until after modern humans had migrated out of Africa. Some of the Neanderthal genes that persist in humans today may influence traits having to do with sun exposure.

The Neanderthal brain was just as big as ours, in fact probably bigger. The skulls of modern humans, while generally larger than those of our earlier ancestors, are also different in shape. This suggests that the modern brain is less of a fixed shape than that of earlier humans and can be influenced over its lifetime by environmental or genetic factors (this is called plasticity). There are some interesting differences when we compare the pattern of brain growth in humans to chimpanzees, our closest living relatives. Both brains grow steadily in the first few years, but the shape of the human brain changes significantly during the first year of life. During this period, the developing brain will be picking up information from its environment providing an opportunity for the outside world to shape the growing neural circuits. Prehistoric skulls. Image credit: Grant Museum, Wellcome Images An analysis of a Neanderthal child’s skull has shown that their growth patterns were more similar to the chimpanzee than to modern humans. This suggests that although the brains of modern humans and Neanderthals reached a similar size by adulthood, this was achieved through different patterns of growth in different regions of the brain. A major constraint on human brain size is the pelvic girdle, which (in females) has to contend with the demands of delivering a large-headed baby. Humans have evolved to extend the period when the brain grows to include the period after birth. This subtle difference in early development might have had big implications for our survival. Language and brain development Language is probably the key characteristic that distinguishes us from other animals. Thanks to our sophisticated language skills, we can convey information rapidly and efficiently to other members of our species. We can coordinate what we do and plan actions, things that would have provided a great advantage early on in our evolution. To understand what someone is saying we need to detect their speech and transmit this information to the brain.

New evidence supports that notion, while also revealing that the world's first anatomically modern humans retained a few Neanderthal-like characteristics. Several papers in the current Journal of Human Evolution describe the world's first known people, which shared bone, hand and ankle features with Neanderthals and possibly also Homo erectus. John Fleagle, professor of anatomical sciences at Stony Brook University, who worked on the early human research, told Discovery News that the shared characteristics \"are just primitive features retained from a common ancestor. \" It's known that Neanderthals had more robust skeletons than modern humans, with particularly strong arms and hands, but were the two groups evenly matched in brainpower?

APA review confirms link between playing violent video games and aggression [Press release]. https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/08/violent-video-games Comment: WASHINGTON — Violent video game play is linked to increased aggression in players but insufficient evidence exists about whether the link extends to criminal violence or delinquency, according to a new American Psychological Association task force report. “The research demonstrates a consistent relation between violent video game use and increases in aggressive behavior, aggressive cognitions and aggressive affect, and decreases in prosocial behavior, empathy and sensitivity to aggression,” says the report of the APA Task Force on Violent Media. The task force’s review is the first in this field to examine the breadth of studies included and to undertake multiple approaches to reviewing the literature. “Scientists have investigated the use of violent video games for more than two decades but to date, there is very limited research addressing whether violent video games cause people to commit acts of criminal violence,” said Mark Appelbaum, PhD, task force chair. “However, the link between violence in video games and increased aggression in players is one of the most studied and best established in the field.” “No single risk factor consistently leads a person to act aggressively or violently,” the report states. “Rather, it is the accumulation of risk factors that tends to lead to aggressive or violent behavior. The research reviewed here demonstrates that violent video game use is one such risk factor.” In light of the task force’s conclusions, APA has called on the industry to design video games that include increased parental control over the amount of violence the games contain. APA’s Council of Representatives adopted a resolution at its meeting Aug. 7 in Toronto encouraging the Entertainment Software Rating Board to refine its video game rating system “to reflect the levels and characteristics of violence in games, in addition to the current global ratings.”", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d2", "source_url": "https://videogames.procon.org/", "snippet": "Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence? 1 Playing violent video games causes more aggression, bullying, and fighting. 60% of middle school boys and 40% of middle school girls who played at least one Mature-rated (M-rated) game hit or beat up someone, compared with 39% of boys and 14% of girls who did not play M-rated games.

By contrast, individuals with low scores of family environment are less likely to help each other; they often openly show anger, attack, and contradiction and do not pay much attention to morality and values. These negative aspects would not decrease but increase their acceptance of violence and aggression.

The moderated mediation model of the relationship between exposure to violent video games and aggression could not only help reveal that exposure to violent video games can affect aggression but also provide an elaboration of the influencing mechanism. According to this model, for individuals with high scores of family environment, exposure to violent video games had only direct effect on aggression. However, for those with low scores of family environment, there was not only a direct effect of exposure to violent video games on aggression but also an indirect effect mediated by normative beliefs about aggression. In short, exposure to violence video games affecting aggression through normative beliefs about aggression is more likely to happen to adolescents with poor family environment than those with good family environment.

Shooting in the Dark The young men who opened fire at Columbine High School, at the movie theater in Aurora, Colo., and in other massacres had this in common: they were video gamers who seemed to be acting out some dark digital fantasy. It was as if all that exposure to computerized violence gave them the idea to go on a rampage — or at least fueled their urges. But did it really? Social scientists have been studying and debating the effects of media violence on behavior since the 1950s, and video games in particular since the 1980s. The issue is especially relevant today, because the games are more realistic and bloodier than ever, and because most American boys play them at some point. Girls play at lower rates and are significantly less likely to play violent games. A burst of new research has begun to clarify what can and cannot be said about the effects of violent gaming. Playing the games can and does stir hostile urges and mildly aggressive behavior in the short term. Moreover, youngsters who develop a gaming habit can become slightly more aggressive — as measured by clashes with peers, for instance — at least over a period of a year or two. Yet it is not at all clear whether, over longer periods, such a habit increases the likelihood that a person will commit a violent crime, like murder, rape, or assault, much less a Newtown-like massacre. (Such calculated rampages are too rare to study in any rigorous way, researchers agree.) “I don’t know that a psychological study can ever answer that question definitively,” said Michael R. Ward, an economist at the University of Texas, Arlington. “We are left to glean what we can from the data and research on video game use that we have.” The research falls into three categories: short-term laboratory experiments; longer-term studies, often based in schools; and correlation studies — between playing time and aggression, for instance, or between video game sales and trends in violent crime.

Based on the video game’s content, the ESRB assigns one of the following ratings: “Early Childhood,” “Everyone,” “Everyone 10+,” “Teen,” “Mature,” “Adults Only,” or “Rating Pending” (only for use in advertising for games not yet rated). In a Pew Research Center 2008 survey, 50% of boys and 14% of girls aged 12-17 listed a game with a “Mature” or “Adults Only” rating in their current top three favorite games.

Until our study, however, this causal association had never been demonstrated experimentally,\" said Bruce Bartholow, associate professor of psychology in the MU College of Arts and Science. During the study, 70 young adult participants were randomly assigned to play either a nonviolent or a violent video game for 25 minutes. Immediately afterwards, the researchers measured brain responses as participants viewed a series of neutral photos, such as a man on a bike, and violent photos, such as a man holding a gun in another man's mouth. Finally, participants competed against an opponent in a task that allowed them to give their opponent a controllable blast of loud noise. The level of noise blast the participants set for their opponent was the measure of aggression. The researchers found that participants who played one of several popular violent games, such as \"Call of Duty,\" \"Hitman,\" \"Killzone\" and \"Grand Theft Auto,\" set louder noise blasts for their opponents during the competitive task -- that is, they were more aggressive -- than participants who played a nonviolent game. In addition, for participants that had not played many violent video games before completing the study, playing a violent game in the lab caused a reduced brain response to the photos of violence -- an indicator of desensitization. Moreover, this reduced brain response predicted participants' aggression levels: the smaller the brain response to violent photos, the more aggressive participants were.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d7", "source_url": "https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/do-video-games-cause-violence", "snippet": "Do Video Games Cause Violence? | Discover Magazine Game Violence Studies For years, research on whether violent video games fuels aggression in players — a field that includes more than 100 studies — remained mixed. For example, in 2014, a meta-analysis from scientists at the University of Innsbruck in Austria found that violent video games boosted aggression in players. Meanwhile, just a year later, a longitudinal study published in Psychology of Popular Media Culture suggested that playing violent video games was not a significant predictor of physical aggression. Ferguson says that some researchers linked video games to aggressive behavior on the basis of shoddy science. In part, he continues, this is due to the perceived high stakes and emotionally charged nature of concerns about youth culture. “There’s this idea that ‘we’re saving children’ or ‘children’s lives are at stake,” he says. “And scientists are human — we respond to social incentives just like anybody else does. If all of the incentives tell you to say one thing, then why would you say the other thing? Saying something isn’t a problem is a hard way to get grant money.” The Problem of False Positives The issue of false positives is just one of the problems plaguing the field. (In the behavioral sciences, “false positives” can occur when scientists deem something as statistically significant when the results are actually a result of chance, sampling errors or problems with a study’s methodology.) In a paper authored by Ferguson and published in the International Journal of Law and Psychiatry in 2018, he found that research into video game violence is particularly prone to false positives. Still, in recent years, more studies and meta-analyses — with more rigorous research methodologies — have added to the growing body of evidence that any connection between video games and aggressive behavior is dubious at best. “Generally speaking, this new wave of better studies is really questioning the perceived wisdom of 10 [to] 15 years ago,” says Ferguson. “That’s kind of where we’re at now.”", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d8", "source_url": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100301111405.htm", "snippet": "Violent video game play makes more aggressive kids, study shows ... Iowa State University Distinguished Professor of Psychology Craig Anderson has made much of his life's work studying how violent video game play affects youth behavior. And he says a new study he led, analyzing 130 research reports on more than 130,000 subjects worldwide, proves conclusively that exposure to violent video games makes more aggressive, less caring kids -- regardless of their age, sex or culture. The study was published in the March 2010 issue of the Psychological Bulletin, an American Psychological Association journal. It reports that exposure to violent video games is a causal risk factor for increased aggressive thoughts and behavior, and decreased empathy and prosocial behavior in youths. \"We can now say with utmost confidence that regardless of research method -- that is experimental, correlational, or longitudinal -- and regardless of the cultures tested in this study [East and West], you get the same effects,\" said Anderson, who is also director of Iowa State's Center for the Study of Violence. \"And the effects are that exposure to violent video games increases the likelihood of aggressive behavior in both short-term and long-term contexts. Such exposure also increases aggressive thinking and aggressive affect, and decreases prosocial behavior. \" The study was conducted by a team of eight researchers, including ISU psychology graduate students Edward Swing and Muniba Saleem; and Brad Bushman, a former Iowa State psychology professor who now is on the faculty at the University of Michigan.

Playing violent video games does not appear to have a meaningful impact on aggression We’ve all heard people blame mass shootings on violent video games- but is there validity to that claim? A study published in Collabra: Psychology refutes the claims and finds that playing shooter video games does not lead to an increase in aggression. With increasing mass violence comes a desire to understand what could be driving this behavior. Whether or not violent video games could be a contributing factor has been a heavily debated and highly contentious conversation in the field for several decades. While earlier research seems to support that violent video games cause aggression, these studies have been criticized for poor quality of data and analyses. “A central shortcoming of evidence so far is poor data quality: Most studies investigate the effects of playing violent video games without actually measuring such play,” wrote study authors Niklas Johannes and colleagues. “If we don’t measure the behavior in question, we cannot advice policymakers on its effects” These issues can make for inaccurate meta-analyses. This study seeks to provide a methodologically sound insight into the link between aggression and playing violent video games. Johannes and colleagues utilized 1,092 players of Apex Legends and 1,488 players of Outriders to serve as their sample. All participants had to be active players of the game in the previous 2 weeks, speak English, and live in the US, UK, or Canada. Participants were asked to partake in 3 waves of the study, which were around 2 weeks apart. Researchers measured time spent playing the game and aggressive affect. Results showed that for both shooter games, there was no significant effect of playing the violent video game on aggressive affect. Additionally, there was no significant effect of aggressive affect on playing the violent video games, meaning that in weeks where players were feeling angrier about other factors, they did not turn to playing video games significantly more. This study found that to see a half-point increase on the aggressive affect scale, each player would need to play for 25-50 hours more per day, which is not possible.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d10", "source_url": "https://dana.org/article/do-violent-video-games-lead-to-violence/", "snippet": "Do Violent Video Games Lead to Violence? | Dana Foundation However, that aggressiveness included insults, threats, hitting, pushing, hair pulling, biting, and other forms of verbal and physical aggression. There was insufficient research on whether violent video games cause lethal violence. Studies have also shown that video game use is associated with a decrease in empathy and other socially desirable behavior. A component of the association, the APA’s division for media psychology and technology, was much more dismissive of any causal link. In a policy statement on June 22, 2017, it found “scant evidence” of any causal connection between playing violent video games and actually committing violent activities” and “little evidence” that playing such games “produces violent criminal behavior.” The warring positions on the issue were judged closer to agreement than most think in a recent analysis. A paper published in Perspectives on Psychological Science on June 12 used what it called “novel analyses” to determine whether conflicting results of meta-analyses were an artifact of reporting practices that masked an underlying consensus. The paper found that “all of the meta/analyses do in fact point to the conclusion that, in the vast majority of settings, violent video games do increase aggressive behavior but that these effects are almost always quite small.” That judgement was consistent with views expressed in separate articles by Benedict Carey and Kevin Draper in the New York TImes on August 5, just after the mass murders in El Paso and Dayton Ohio. One respected organization, the National Center for Health Research, a non-profit non-partisan organization that critiques medical research, leans in the direction of worrying about triggering lethal assaults. It published an article on “Violent Video Games and Aggression” which found that: “Very few studies have looked at whether playing violent video games increases the chance of later delinquency, criminal behavior, or lethal violence.

Furthermore, violent video games may be more harmful than violent television and movies because they are interactive, very engrossing and require the player to identify with the aggressor, say the researchers. \"One study reveals that young men who are habitually aggressive may be especially vulnerable to the aggression-enhancing effects of repeated exposure to violent games,\" said psychologists Craig A. Anderson, Ph.D., and Karen E. Dill, Ph.D. \"The other study reveals that even a brief exposure to violent video games can temporarily increase aggressive behavior in all types of participants. \" The first study involved 227 college students who completed a measure of trait aggressiveness and reported their actual aggressive behaviors (delinquency) in the recent past. They also reported their video game playing habits. \"We found that students who reported playing more violent video games in junior and high school engaged in more aggressive behavior,\" said lead author Anderson, of Iowa State University. \"We also found that amount of time spent playing video games in the past was associated with lower academic grades in college. \" In the second study, 210 college students played either a violent (Wolfenstein 3D) or nonviolent video game (Myst). A short time later, the students who played the violent video game punished an opponent (received a noise blast with varying intensity) for a longer period of time than did students who had played the nonviolent video game. \"Violent video games provide a forum for learning and practicing aggressive solutions to conflict situations,\" said Dr. Anderson. \"In the short run, playing a violent video game appears to affect aggression by priming aggressive thoughts.

That is because this study used a combination of subjective and objective data to measure teen aggression and violence in games. Compared to previous research on the subject, which relied on self-reported data from teenagers, this study used information from parents and carers to judge the level of aggressive behavior in their children. What’s more, the content of the video games was classified using the official PEGI and ESRB rating systems, rather than just the player’s perceptions of the amount of violence in the game. If you're curious about the sampling here, as you should be, then it comprised of British 14 to 15-year olds and an equal number of parents or carers, totaling 2,008 subjects in all. The result of this thorough approach showed that there was no link between violent video games and teenage aggression, something that the lead researcher Professor Andrew Przybylski went on to clarify. The idea that violent video games drive real-world aggression is a popular one, but it hasn’t tested very well over time. Despite interest in the topic by parents and policy-makers, the research has not demonstrated that there is cause for concern.

Researchers at the University of York have found no evidence to support the theory that video games make players more violent. In a series of experiments, with more than 3,000 participants, the team demonstrated that video game concepts do not 'prime' players to behave in certain ways and that increasing the realism of violent video games does not necessarily increase aggression in game players. The dominant model of learning in games is built on the idea that exposing players to concepts, such as violence in a game, makes those concepts easier to use in 'real life'. This is known as 'priming', and is thought to lead to changes in behaviour. Previous experiments on this effect, however, have so far provided mixed conclusions. Researchers at the University of York expanded the number of participants in experiments, compared to studies that had gone before it, and compared different types of gaming realism to explore whether more conclusive evidence could be found. In one study, participants played a game where they had to either be a car avoiding collisions with trucks or a mouse avoiding being caught by a cat. Following the game, the players were shown various images, such as a bus or a dog, and asked to label them as either a vehicle or an animal. Dr David Zendle, from the University's Department of Computer Science, said: \"If players are 'primed' through immersing themselves in the concepts of the game, they should be able to categorise the objects associated with this game more quickly in the real world once the game had concluded. advertisement \"Across the two games we didn't find this to be the case. Participants who played a car-themed game were no quicker at categorising vehicle images, and indeed in some cases their reaction time was significantly slower. \" In a separate, but connected study, the team investigated whether realism influenced the aggression of game players. Research in the past has suggested that the greater the realism of the game the more primed players are by violent concepts, leading to antisocial effects in the real world. Dr Zendle said: \"There are several experiments looking at graphic realism in video games, but they have returned mixed results. There are, however, other ways that violent games can be realistic, besides looking like the 'real world', such as the way characters behave for example.", "timestamp": ""}], "per_doc_notes": [{"doc_id": "d1", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "An APA task force report found that violent video game play is linked to increased aggression in players.", "quote": "Violent video game play is linked to increased aggression in players but insufficient evidence exists about whether the link extends to criminal violence or delinquency, according to a new American Psychological Association task force report.", "verdict_reason": "The snippet explicitly states that violent video game play is linked to increased aggression, directly answering the query.", "source_quality": "high"}, {"doc_id": "d2", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "A 2014 peer-reviewed study found that habitual violent video game playing had a causal link with increased long-term aggressive behavior.", "quote": "A 2014 peer-reviewed study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that habitual violent video game playing had a causal link with increased, long-term, aggressive behavior.", "verdict_reason": "The snippet explicitly states a causal link between violent video game play and increased aggressive behavior, directly answering the query.", "source_quality": "low"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "verdict": "partially supports", "key_fact": "The study indicates that exposure to violent video games can affect aggression, but the effect depends on individual and environmental factors such as family environment.", "quote": "The proposed model incorporated some perspectives of GAM and CM: while confirming the effect of exposure to violent video games on aggression occurrence, the combined effect of individual and environmental factors was verified.", "verdict_reason": "The snippet links violent video games to aggression but limits the effect to certain conditions, making it partial rather than general support.", "source_quality": "high"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "verdict": "partially supports", "key_fact": "Research shows playing violent video games can stir hostile urges and mildly aggressive behavior in the short term, but it is unclear if it leads to violent crime over longer periods.", "quote": "Playing the games can and does stir hostile urges and mildly aggressive behavior in the short term.

Elbert comes in as a close second to Mount Whitney with a peak of 14,433 feet (4,399 meters) above sea level. Much of the mountain can be reached using paved roads, which makes the ascent much quicker and easier than other tallest mountains. Advertisement 7.

List Description The fifty state high points of the United States are an increasingly popular peakbagging pursuit. There is a club (the Highpointers) and several guidebooks to completing this diverse list of peaks. Of the fifty high points, five require real mountaineering skills: Denali in Alaska; Washington's Mount Rainier and Oregon's Mount Hood in the Pacific Northwest; and Montana's Granite Peak and Wyoming's Gannett Peak in the Rockies. Another five or so (Rhode island, Illinois, Kentucky, and others) are on private land and require landowner permission. Most of the remaining state summits are easy hikes or drive-ups. Hiking the cool forests of the Appalachians, exploring the windy, lonely high plains, and backpacking above treeline in the western mountains are all part of the great fun of this scavenger hunt.

Though later praised for his estimate, Dickey admitted that other prospector parties had also guessed the mountain to be over 20,000 feet (6,100 m).[55] These estimates were confirmed in 1898 by the surveyor Robert Muldrow, who measured its elevation as 20,300 feet (6,200 m).[56] Climbing history During the summer of 1902 scientist Alfred Brooks explored the flanks of the mountain as a part of an exploratory surveying party conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey.

Photograph by Aaron Huey, courtesy of the National Geographic image collection Denali, also called Mount McKinley, is the tallest mountain in North America, located in south-central Alaska. With a peak that reaches 6,190 meters (20,310 feet) above sea level, Denali is the third-highest of the Seven Summits (the tallest peaks on all seven continents). Denali is about 210 kilometers (130 miles) north-northwest of Anchorage. Sixty million years ago, tectonic uplift pushed Earth's crust upward, forming Denali and the other Alaska Range mountains. Denali is the centerpiece of the Denali National Park and Preserve, which spans 2.4 million hectares (6 million acres) of land. “Denali” comes from Koyukon, a traditional Native Alaskan language, and means “the tall one.” This name had been used for many generations and was used by early non-Native researchers and naturalists. But in 1896, William A. Dickey, a prospector, began calling Denali “Mount McKinley,” in honor of William McKinley, a presidential candidate at the time. After McKinley became president and was later assassinated, Congress formally recognized the name in 1917, despite McKinley’s tenuous ties to Alaska (he had never visited). But Native Alaskans, as well as locals of varied backgrounds, continued to call the mountain Denali. In 1975, a movement began to rename the mountain Denali, but it was blocked by politicians in Ohio, McKinley’s home state. Finally, President Barack Obama and Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell took action in 2015 to change the name back to Denali, which is now its official name.", "timestamp": "2023-10-19"}], "per_doc_notes": [{"doc_id": "d1", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "Denali in Alaska is the highest summit in the United States.", "quote": "Denali in Alaska is the highest summit of the United States and all of North America.", "verdict_reason": "The snippet explicitly identifies Denali in Alaska as the highest point in the United States.", "source_quality": "high"}, {"doc_id": "d2", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "Denali in Alaska, at 20,310 feet above sea level, is the highest point in the United States.", "quote": "At 20,310 feet (6.2km) above sea level, the highest point in the United States is Denali, Alaska (formerly known as Mount McKinley).", "verdict_reason": "The snippet explicitly names Denali, Alaska, and gives its elevation as the highest point in the U.S.", "source_quality": "low"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "Denali, formerly Mount McKinley, is identified as the tallest mountain in the United States.", "quote": "Denali (formerly Mount McKinley) is the tallest mountain in the world, at 18,000 feet", "verdict_reason": "The snippet explicitly names Denali as the tallest mountain, directly answering the query about the highest point in the U.S.", "source_quality": "low"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "verdict": "partially supports", "key_fact": "Mount Denali is described as North America's tallest mountain.", "quote": "Mount Denali is staggeringly huge.

Using Dishwater to Water Plants: Which Greywater is Safe in the Garden? The next time you come up dry due to watering restrictions, consider using dishwater to keep your flowers and veggies from dying of thirst. The detergent residue in the water won’t hurt them; as you might recall, dish soap is often used as a base for natural pesticides, because it helps the mixture stick to the plants, isn’t toxic, and can be easily washed off later. Just make sure your dish soap does not contain boron or bleach. You can read more in the article below about boron compounds and chlorine and how they can hurt plants. Now, one caveat here: dishwater is classified as a type of “greywater,” because it tends to be cloudy rather than clear. While it’s not considered sewage as such, in some areas, you’re required by law to dispose of greywater through a proper sewer system. Therefore, it’s a good idea to check your local regulations before dousing the daisies with dishwater. Also, keep in mind that while dishwater is fine to use on your plants, not all greywater is created equal. If you’ve used water to wash poultry parts, for example, don’t use it to water anything you’ll later be eating, because of the risk of bacterial contamination. Bathwater, of course, is right out. Comments I do not disagree with NOT using water from a bathtub or from washing poultry, as examples, for watering food one might eat. EXCEPT for fruit and other trees, and flower gardens. If fruit trees are properly pruned, there should be no danger of fruit contamination. This is especially true in climates where heat and sun are going to sterilize ground surfaces.

Is washing up water ok to water plants with? Hi there. I've read and heard a couple of times now that using spent washing-up water is ok to use in the garden to water plants with (as long as there's no bleach in it) and as I'm keen to re-use waste where possible, I'm interested to know your thoughts on this please? I would imagine it's perhaps best to let the suds evaporate first? Many thanks in advance. I would not want to use washing up water on my plants as its the residues of food - fat, salts etc. that would be the things I would be concerned about. I would also be unhappy about washing up liquids - unless organic - leaching their chemical content into the water table as these chemicals are highly toxic to aquatic life. This is what I used on my garden during the mid 1970s drought and I have never had such fabulous plants, but that might have had something to do with the fact that I was religiously watering the things instead of neglecting them slightly. I also used the bathwater which meant walking downstairs with buckets of sudsy water..... I'm sure it was a great exercise regime. Its not something I would like to do long term as I think the plants deserve something clean occasionally and I have no idea how much detergent formulae have changed since those far off days but I'd say, give it a go. We should use more grey water...... it would be great if loos could be plumbed into the system to reuse washing up and bath/shower water for flushing. Prolonged dry spells were always called 'teaspoons in the heather' weather in my Mum's garden. None of the plants came to any harm from the dishwater. The odd dinted flower from being clattered by the teaspoon that lingers at the bottom of the washing up bowl though “Light thinks it travels faster than anything but it is wrong.

The rinse water is pretty clear and clean so I feel like it is all right to water plants with but what about the water the dishes are washed in. Is it all right to pour around plants like the garden plants? Back years ago when everyone used dish pans they used to have the best gardens right out the back door where they threw the water. The soaps they used back then were real soap instead of the detergents we have today so you might want to use caution until your sure of the results. MIL uses regular dish detergent (Dawn?) to do the dishes at the farm, and always pours it out on the plants. So far, so good! I think I'd avoid any anti-bacterial detergents, though.

Article continues below this ad And insecticidal soap spray should be reapplied to pest-affected garden plants every four to seven days until the pests are controlled. Unlike chemical sprays, insecticidal soap spray kills only when it coats an insect. The spray has no residual affect and is no longer effective after it dries. Insecticidal soap spray is safer and more effective when applied to healthy, well-watered plants and may damage weak or sensitive plants. If you are unsure about a plant's sensitivity or health, then spray an inconspicuous leaf on the plant, and check it for signs of damage 48 hours later. Early morning is the best time to apply an insecticidal soap spray, which should never be used when the temperature is above 90 degrees Fahrenheit or when the sun shines directly on the plants being treated. Using Dishwater for Plants Many public health officials recommend that dishwater, also known as graywater, be used for watering plants only when fresh water isn't available for irrigation. Although dishwater will keep plants alive, it may contain food particles and other materials that can attract rodents and insect pests to the flowerbeds on which it is used. If you use dishwater for watering your flowerbeds, then it's critical to take precautions to keep the beds' plants and soil safe. Avoid pouring dishwater directly at the bases of plants because it may cause root and stem rot. Pour the dishwater evenly on the soil around the perimeter of each plant. Apply dishwater along a tree's or shrub's drip line. A drip line is an imaginary line, or circle, on the ground where water drips from a plant's outermost branches. Dishwater from dish soap that contains bleach shouldn't be used to water any kinds of plants. If your home has a water softener, then use dishwater sparingly because the water contains a higher level of sodium than normal water; sodium can harm plants over time. M.H.

Apply water slowly to the base of plants. This will reduce water usage by about 50%. The soaker hose or \"leaky pipe\" is a hose that allows water to seep out all along its length at a slow rate. Apply irrigation under the mulch if possible. Critical watering periods for vegetables. You can target the timing and amount of water to add. As a rule of thumb, water is most critical during the first few weeks of development, immediately after transplanting, and during flowering and fruit production. Control weeds. Weeds can out-compete garden plants for water. Pull them when they are small, making sure to remove all the roots. When returning to your garden after a time away, be sure to pull the weeds that are ready to flower or go to seed first. Save rainwater for your plants. Save as much rainwater as you can by putting a rain collector under the downspouts from your roof. In the house, save the water that you run from the tap while you're waiting for the temperature to get hot or cold. In Pennsylvania, we cannot use water that has been in contact with people (bath water, shower water, or dishwater) to water our plants. Mulch and mulch properly: Use 1 to 2 inches around vegetable plants. Mulch will keep the soil temperature cooler and it will keep moisture in the ground rather than letting it go out into the environment. By using an organic mulch, you will also be adding organic material and nutrients to the soil. Mulching minimizes evaporation of water from the soil surface, reducing irrigation need by around 50%. Grass clippings make excellent mulch for the vegetable garden. Apply fresh clippings in thin layers (up to 1/4 inch thick) and allow each layer to dry before adding more. The clippings quickly dry down and additional layers can be added weekly. Do not place fresh clippings in thick piles, as they will mat, decay, and cause odors.

We all love beautiful, thriving gardens, but it’s important to think about how we can garden responsibly to save water and protect our environment, to make sure there’s enough to go around in the future. Save water and slow the flow in your garden Use a watering can instead of a hose or sprinkler - Avoid using hosepipes or sprinklers which can use as much as 1,000 litres of clean water an hour. Re-use dishwater or water used to boil vegetables or pasta, and fill a watering can instead. Using a watering can could save up to 4,050 litres a year, that’s equivalent to more than 50 full bathtubs. Leave your lawn - Lawns go brown in dry weather, but they soon bounce back after rainfall. So, they don’t need watering in between. However, you can retain the lawn’s moisture for longer by giving the roots some shade – try trimming your grass slightly longer during dry spells and leave the cuttings on the ground. Time your watering - Water plants before the sun comes out in the morning if you can - then it's less likely to evaporate, and will do the most good. Watering in the evening encourages the slugs and snails to come out at night. Spead some mulch - Apply a thick layer of mulch, compost or chip bark on your soil between plants to help keep the moisture in and suppress weeds. Fit a water butt - Water your garden for free by collecting rainwater in a water butt. Each one holds up to 200 litres of water which you can use around your garden. Rainwater is rich in nutrients, so your plants will love it too. If your area is prone to surface flooding, why not try a slow-drain water butt instead?

Set your sprinklers to come on between 4:00 am and 10:00 am. Use mulching material; pine bark, cedar chips, etc. around the roots of plants and trees to help the soil retain water. Make sure your sprinklers aimed appropriately so that they aren’t watering the sidewalks and streets in front of your house. INDOORS Save dishwater and bathwater for watering plants. (When you shower, keep a bucket in the shower to collect the water.) The soap isn’t harmful. In fact, it kills aphids and other plant-destroying insects. You can also save cooking water to water plants. Don’t let the water run while you brush your teeth. Run the dishwasher and washing machine only when they are full. Fix any leaky fixtures, toilets, faucets, etc., as soon as you discover the leak. You can usually just replace a washer or two for a couple of dollars. Don’t flush bugs, tissues, or pet waste. Wrap them up and throw them into the trash. Showers use less water than baths, especially if you keep them to five minutes or less; try keeping a timer to try and keep the time down. Keep a water pitcher in the refrigerator. Running the tap to get cold water wastes gallons. By doing your part to conserve water, and encouraging your neighbors to do theirs, you can help to protect Georgia’s water resource supply.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d9", "source_url": "https://www.vegetable-gardening-online.com/watering-tomato-plants.html", "snippet": "Watering Tomato Plants For Best Results Recycling Water The chemicals and bleach in gray-water hinders the ability of plants to soak in nutrition and may contaminate the water table as well. Water-Conserving Devises Garden centers sell all sorts of water-conserving devices for use when vegetable gardening. However, you can make your own. Soaker or seep hoses are a good option, especially in beds of vegetables. Pierce a length of hose with tiny pinprick holes along its length and lay it among your plants, attaching one end to the faucet. Soaker hoses work best in short lengths. Drip Systems for Watering Tomatoes Installing a drip system to water your vegetable garden plants is a great way to go. Drip systems conserve water, and offer a slow steady supply of water to the tomato plant without disturbing the plant root system. It is actually very easy to install a drip system, so don't be overwhelmed by the idea! Adding a timer to the drip system will allow you to water your garden automatically at the same time each day, or every other day as desired. Add Mulch to Conserve Water Adding a 2-3 inch layer of organic mulch to the topsoil of your garden will help prevent the soil from drying too quickly through evaporation. Mulching also is an effective way of adding slow-release fertilizer or nutrients to your garden plants each time you water. How Much Water is Enough? In general, most vegetable garden plants, including tomato plants, require about 1\" of water per week. During especially hot dry weather, or if you haven't added a layer of mulch to prevent evaporation, it may be necessary to water an extra half-inch per week. Many expert gardeners greatly reduce the amount of water to their tomatoes after the plants have reached maturity and have set fruit. The idea behind this is that stressing the plants a bit encourages fruit to develop more quickly.", "timestamp": ""}], "per_doc_notes": [{"doc_id": "d1", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "Dishwater can be used to water plants as long as the dish soap does not contain boron or bleach.", "quote": "The detergent residue in the water won’t hurt them; as you might recall, dish soap is often used as a base for natural pesticides, because it helps the mixture stick to the plants, isn’t toxic, and can be easily washed off later.

This is a time of immense significance in the Islamic community. The month-long, lunar holiday serves as a sacred period of introspection, spiritual growth and self-discipline for Muslims worldwide. Ramadan is a time marked by fasting from dawn to sunset, when Muslims abstain not only from food and drink, but from daily pleasures as well. Fasting during Ramadan serves as a powerful reminder of empathy and compassion for those less fortunate. By experiencing hunger and thirst, individuals gain a heightened understanding of the struggles faced by those who live in poverty. This shared experience fosters a sense of solidarity and motivates believers to engage in acts of charity, kindness and community service. It becomes a time for selflessness, reinforcing the importance of generosity and helping those in need. During this Ramadan season, I ask the campus community to be flexible with students recognizing the holiday as they may be absent from class during prayer time and may request extra accommodations to complete their assigned work. Stay tuned to Marquette Today and the Campus Ministry Instagram for more information on an upcoming Iftar dinner hosted by Campus Ministry. Ramadan serves as a transformative period, encouraging individuals to transcend their worldly desires and cultivate qualities of patience, gratitude and humility. Through self-control, believers aim to purify their hearts and souls, striving for a higher level of consciousness and spiritual enlightenment. Ramadan, therefore, stands as a beacon of self-discipline and personal growth, guiding individuals to a more virtuous and fulfilling life.

As we work toward promoting a more inclusive Spartan community, here are some facts to consider: Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar and is widely considered the month in which the Qur’an (Koran), the Islamic holy book, was first revealed. This year, Ramadan will begin at sunset on April 12, give or take a day (depending on when the new moon is sighted), and will last 29 or 30 days. As the Islamic year is approximately 11 days shorter than the Gregorian year, Ramadan in 2022 will begin around April 1. Fasting in the month of Ramadan is one of the “five pillars” of Islam. The Qur’an (2:183) states that fasting was prescribed so that believers may attain God-consciousness. Accordingly, Ramadan is widely regarded as a month of spiritual growth. Practicing Muslims who are able to do so are expected to abstain from eating, drinking (including water) and sexual relations from dawn to sunset each day of the month. Many Muslims will also perform various prayers and acts of devotion, especially at night, sometimes past midnight. And as many adherents also wake up early for predawn meals, they may experience not just hunger and thirst but also fatigue. Those who are ill, traveling, or unable to fast for other reasons are exempt from the Ramadan fast. Those who are able to do so are expected to make up the missed days at a later time. The end of Ramadan is marked by the Islamic holiday Eid al-Fitr (“the festival of the breaking of the fast”), which will begin this year at sunset on May 12, give or take a day.

The Islamic calendar is lunar, meaning each month begins with a new astronomical moon. As lunar months are shorter than solar, the Islamic calendar does not correspond with the Gregorian calendar followed in the West, so that means Ramadan occurs around 10 days earlier every year. The period takes place in the ninth month of the Islamic year. Its precise date also varies from country to country by about a day, depending on when the moon is sighted. Followers of the faith are encouraged to check the precise timings of sunrise and sunset with their local mosques to ensure the fast is not inadvertently broken prematurely. Why do Muslims fast? ​Ramadan is a holy month dedicated to prayer and reading the Quran. Generosity and giving to worthy causes and neighbours are encouraged. It is a period for reflection, self-restraint, and warmth intended to bring Muslims closer to Allah, hence the abstention from earthly distractions like food and water, cigarettes, and sexual activity during daylight hours. A modest meal is taken before dawn known as “suhoor” and after dusk known as “iftar” but nothing whatsoever is consumed in between, not even water.

The holy month of Ramadan is the 9th month in the Islamic lunar calendar. It is a month of fasting, worship, service, communal gathering, and spiritual development. Fasting in Ramadan is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. Since there are 12 lunar months superimposed over 12 solar months, Ramadan “moves back” about 11 days per solar year. In 2024, the first day of fasting is expected to be March 11, though given differing interpretive schools among Muslim communities, some may declare the month to begin a day before or after the predicted date. Likewise, the holiday commemorating the end of fasting, most often called Eid al-Fitr in the US, may fall on different days according to varying family, cultural, or interpretive preferences. The Eid holiday that marks the end of fasting is expected around April 9 (dates may vary). It consists of a congregational prayer in the morning followed by visiting family and friends. The full day of Eid is a holiday, not just the morning prayers, and many will choose to take the day off. As such, it is an excused absence per the Academic Coursework and Religious Observance Policy. Others may prefer to return to school or work and take exams on Eid. In some cultures, the two days after Eid are also counted as part of the holiday. Key takeaways: Fasting is defined as no food, drink, or sexual relations from before the first light of dawn until the setting of the sun. Ramadan will be approximately March 10 - April 9 in 2024. Fasting times in 2024 are between 5:46 a.m. and 6:48 p.m. at the beginning of Ramadan and 4:52 a.m.- 7:21p.m. by the end of Ramadan. Some may start fasting earlier and break fast later.

Resources for the Month of Ramadan The month of Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and commemorates the first revelation of God to the Prophet Mohammad for the Muslim community. The fasting of the month of Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Muslim faith, and observant Muslims will not eat or drink from sunrise to sunset during the month, which is from the sighting of one crescent moon to the next. This is a season of reflection, contemplation, and empathy; the act of fasting during the month of Ramadan is to redirect one’s attention from earthly self-centered things to an awareness and commitment to higher ideals and purposes. The holy month also includes additional attention to one’s prayer life and the recitation of the Qur'an. The gathering for fast breaking each night during the month of Ramadan, iftars, is a significant moment of community connection and joy. Traditionally dates are eaten at the breaking of the fast each night before prayers, commemorating the Prophet Mohammad’s practice of breaking the fast by eating three dates. The struggle of the fast, therefore, is complimented by the celebration of sharing a meal with others. For most Muslims, the month of Ramadan begins this year on Sunday, March 10 and ends on April 9. Each person engages their religious life and the challenges of fasting differently.

In the 1960s, social norms were changing as sex became more widely discussed in society. Erotic media, such as films, magazines, and books, became more popular and gained widespread attention across the country. These changes reveal that sex was entering the public domain, and sex rates, especially among young people, could no longer be ignored.[1] With the introduction of the pill and second-wave feminism, women gained more control over their bodies and sexuality during the 1960s. Women could engage in sex without the risk of pregnancy.[2] At the same time, many women involved in the feminist movement questioned the traditional gender and sex roles ascribed to them. Women's liberation movements sought to free women from social and moral confines.[3] Developments in the gay rights movement occurred during the same period, such as public demonstrations and protests to challenge discrimination against sexuality. Some activists began celebrating homosexuality, but the movement did not really take off until the Stonewall riots of 1969.[4] In America, a dramatic shift in traditional ideas about sex and sexuality arose from a number of social changes. In 1969, Blue Movie, directed by Andy Warhol, premiered.[5] Films as early as the 1880s contained sexual images and some pornographic content was filmed in the 1920s, but Blue Movie was the first erotic film to gain wide theatrical release.[6][7] This film helped to introduce “porno chic” and the Golden Age of Porn (1969-1984). Pornography became a publicly discussed topic that was taken seriously by critics.[8][9] Magazines depicting erotic and nude content increased in circulation at this time as well. After Playboy’s founding in 1953, the magazine was selling 1.1 million copies by 1960.[10]", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d2", "source_url": "https://academic.oup.com/tcbh/article/34/2/354/7110241", "snippet": "Political Sexual Revolution: Sexual Autonomy in the British Women's ... The active engagement by women with this question of sexual selfhood belies a historiography of sexual revolution—real or imagined—in which women were the passive beneficiaries (or victims) of technological, cultural, religious, social and/or, economic shifts. Drawing on the writing of women in the feminist press, mainstream media, books, and pamphlets, this article describes the specific contribution of the WLM to shaping new possibilities for a sexuality defined, and controlled, by women. I argue that the WLM combined a powerful political framework with an influential social network to significantly contribute to a far-reaching process of deconstructing and recasting female sexuality and sexual relations. ‘Not long ago I made the intellectual decision to become bisexual’, 25-year-old London resident Linda told Guardian reporter Lindsay Mackie in 1973.1 Separated from her husband and in love with a man at the time of her interview, Linda continued: ‘I am in a bit of a state of flux with this new-found independence but I feel amazingly self-contained.’ For Linda, this independence was as much physical as anything else. ‘I come back home and I feel the outlines of myself’, she explained. I‘m not living through anyone else and almost every day I say to myself “I’m me and I’ll never be anything else and I’m satisfied with it.”’ Linda’s description of her choice as an ‘intellectual decision’ is telling. From the late 1960s, British women started a conversation about their bodies and sex as part of a broader, self-conscious exploration of autonomy.2 Linda had attended her first women’s group meeting in 1972. It was the start of an involvement with the Women’s Liberation Movement (WLM) that would alter her perspective and ultimately her life. ‘I see everything now in a political way’, she explained.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d3", "source_url": "https://www.cnn.com/2015/07/21/opinions/kohn-seventies-sexual-revolution/index.html", "snippet": "The sex freak-out of the 1970s In 1970, the first gay pride parade was held to commemorate the Stonewall Riots, and in 1973, the American Psychiatric Association finally saw fit to remove homosexuality from its official list of mental disorders. Arguably, one of the quintessential songs of the 1970s captures all perspectives on the sexual revolution. “Aaaaaah, FREAK OUT!” sang the band, Chic, in their 1978 chart topper. While the old guard was certainly freaking out about the quickly and wildly shifting terrain of traditional American values, those doing the shifting were enjoying the ride. The song almost mocks those who are actually freaking out, turning their angst into a dance craze. “Come on along and have a real good time,” Chic invites. That moral ground you feel shifting below you? Think of it more as a sensual undulating and get with the groove. It’s easy to look back and see the boundaries of the era’s aspirations. The Vietnam War, in the 1970s, and AIDS, in the 1980s, killed people and rightfully became preoccupying life-and-death issues. Complete sexual liberation and the brave new peaceful world a generation longed for ran headlong into hard and brutal reality. In hindsight, the movements of the 1970s were much more about cultural triumphs than they were about legal and political changes. That the idea of women’s equality is more widely accepted today than it was 40 years ago is a victory. Yet the fact that women still earn a fraction of what men earn on average, and women of color even less, that rape and sexual assault remain so prevalent, that access to birth control and abortion and sex education are so actively still contested — these are reminders of how far we have yet to go. “In the 1970s the sexual revolution was really mostly about sex,” wrote Hanna Rosin. “But now the sexual revolution has deepened into a more permanent kind of power for women.” Or, more accurately I think, at least a sense of personal power.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d4", "source_url": "https://independent-magazine.org/2018/11/11/there-were-no-laws-against-it-then/", "snippet": "Kerry McElroy Writes about Elizabeth Taylor and Hugh Hefner for ...

But with so much change in the air, how did American corporate male interests respond? Further, in an era when women were beginning to throw out their girdles, read feminist theory, and join consciousness-raising movements, what became of the most objectifying business of all—Hollywood? As has happened over and over again in Hollywood history, things didn’t go as we might expect. The 1960s represents, like previous decades, a lost opportunity for women as regards equality in the film industry. One particularly apt late studio-era Hollywood dynamic that demonstrated mistreatment as still the norm was the relationship between director and actress. The quintessential 1960s director, Alfred Hitchcock, had a typical albeit extreme version of the attitude that actors were annoyances—bodies to stage, voices to recite lines—who got in the way of a director’s vision and genius.

Women’s studies courses were first offered in 1969; degrees followed in 1970. Feminism grew stronger as a social movement during the 1970s, expanding through “consciousness-raising” groups. Feminists won new political rights, including: The 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bars discrimination in hiring on the basis of sex; Title X of the Public Health Service Act (1970), which provides access to contraceptive services; Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments, which bars discrimination on the basis of sex in “any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance” and that requires federal funds be allocated equally to male and female collegiate programs; and The 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act, which barred discrimination on the basis of “pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.” Women as a civil rights group received heightened scrutiny protection in Craig v.

The ACLU lawyer in that case, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, who now sits on the Supreme Court of the United States, recently commented that feminism as a movement would not be over until the Supreme Court had nine female justices.[65] The feminist movement’s concept of gender went hand in hand with the sexual revolution, which Marcuse said was essential for a political revolution: “The New Left should develop the political implications of the moral and sexual rebellion of the youth….

For a substantial part of the younger generation, the solid connections between sex, love, marriage and reproduction that had characterized the modern approach to family and relationships became much looser. The newly emerging infrastructure for sexual health (both secular and religious) played an important role in making contraceptives, particularly the pill, widely available and widely used in a relatively short period of time. In addition, this broader availability of contraceptives made possible a broader recognition and acceptance of sex and pleasure as avenues towards personal development and liberation even among the general population who had not been part of these emancipatory movements. Scholars and activists have also pointed out that this ‘liberation’ has had mixed results, or could be called incomplete. Sociological, public health and historical research correct or even debunk the myth of sexual liberation. While new structures governing sexuality emerged, older ones continued. Cases in point are the emphasis on romantic love that resulted in people marrying at a younger age, and women’s continued experiences of sexual and gender-based violence during and after this period (Hekma and Stolk, 1990).|17While until the 1980s marriage continued to be important, it was an expression of choice and no longer part of family negotiations. After the 1980s there was a qualitative change visible in marriage and relationships.| Rather than having been liberated since the 1960s, sexuality is still shaped in the context of gender inequality, while it has also become part of new regimes of gendered and racialized power differences, as several scholars have noted (Balkenhol et al., 2016; Bartelink and Wiering, 2020; Knibbe, 2018; Roodsaz, 2018).", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d8", "source_url": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/op-ed/bs-ed-op-0330-mgoldberg-sex-positivity-20220329-bycmlwcch5hrxly7jatp5lrfsy-story.html", "snippet": "Michelle Goldberg: A modern manifesto against sex positivity ...

The invention of the birth control pill and open conversations about women’s sexual liberation encouraged the normalization of extramarital and casual sex. Here, a model gets her body painted in Los Angeles in 1967. (Michael Ochs Archives / Getty Images) [Pictured: Models get their bodies painted for a \"paint-in\" in Los Angeles, 1967.] (Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Image) Almost exactly a year ago, writer Katherine Dee, who blogs about internet culture and trend forecasting, predicted what she called a “coming wave of sex negativity.” Sex positivity, she suggested, had created new stigmas, including around discussing the harms of sex work and self-commodification. “People do not want to be atomized,” she wrote, adding, “Nobody wants this dystopia.” Not everything Ms. Dee foresaw — like a shift toward earlier childbearing among the upper-middle class — has come to pass, at least so far. But she nailed an emerging movement, one that now has a manifesto in “Rethinking Sex: A Provocation” by Washington Post columnist Christine Emba, which I found bold and compelling even when I disagreed with it. Ms. Emba’s argument is that sexual liberation, as currently conceived, has made people, and especially women, miserable. It has created, ironically, new strictures and secret shames, at least in certain elite milieus, around “catching feelings,” hating casual sex and having vanilla sexual tastes.

The Case Against the Sexual Revolution: A New Guide to Sex in the 21st Century Ditching the stuffy hang-ups and benighted sexual traditionalism of the past is an unambiguously positive thing. The sexual revolution has liberated us to enjoy a heady mixture of erotic freedom and personal autonomy. Right? Wrong, argues Louise Perry in her provocative new book. Although it would be neither possible nor desirable to turn the clock back to a world of pre-60s sexual mores, she argues that the amoral libertinism and callous disenchantment of liberal feminism and our contemporary hypersexualised culture represent more loss than gain. The main winners from a world of rough sex, hook-up culture and ubiquitous porn - where anything goes and only consent matters - are a tiny minority of high-status men, not the women forced to accommodate the excesses of male lust. While dispensing sage advice to the generations paying the price for these excesses, she makes a passionate case for a new sexual culture built around dignity, virtue and restraint. This countercultural polemic from one of the most exciting young voices in contemporary feminism should be read by all men and women uneasy about the mindless orthodoxies of our ultraliberal era. Author says she moved on from her “liberal” views as she matured. Great direction, and I love the message, but - influenced by the godless elitist portion of British society in which she grew up, and where I lived for many years - she doesn’t seem to understand that without God as a primary source, nothing can have real meaning, especially when it comes to our fundamental relationships. Even her practical advice remains untethered, because she has been taught (by her friends and social environment) to reject what she calls “religion and tradition”. Writing with great intelligence, she struggles to build the right type of framework (marriage is good, porn is bad, etc.) from scratch and she gets to so many great conclusions that, without any metaphysical context, remain suspended in mid-air.

What she found instead was young men sitting around the students' union bar making smutty jokes. She sank into a depression that lasted several years. During this time, she started sleeping around with men, considering it her \"duty\" to be liberated and progressive. This was the start of her interest in the politics of the sexual revolution, which was to result in her book Anticlimax: A Feminist Perspective On The Sexual Revolution (1990), in which she argues that newly achieved and much-vaunted sexual freedom did not constitute any real gain for women, but continued their oppression in another guise. After university, while teaching at a girls' boarding school in 1972, she read Kate Millet's Sexual Politics, a groundbreaking analysis of female oppression and patriarchy. She became \"enraged\" at what she learned about men's abuse and control of women. \"My rage has never gone away,\" she says now. \"I am grateful for that.\" She says she distinctly remembers the moment she realised, during a conversation about politics with a man, that he was seeing her merely as a woman, and therefore inferior. \"I was furious.

As many scholars have noted, the rise of the women’s liberation movement in the late 1960s grew out of women activists’ rejection of the “male chauvinism” of the New Left.[7] Feminist critics pointed out that, as envisioned by the male leadership of the New Left, the radical politics of liberation was perfectly compatible with a traditional practice of subordinating women to men. Thus, for example, some feminists argued that the sexual revolution was not necessarily liberating for women, and that unconventional living arrangements often involved not so much a rejection of the bourgeois institution of marriage as a reinstantiation of its exploitative appropriation of women’s emotional, physical, and sexual labor. As part of her contribution to the manifesto, “Toward a Female Liberation Movement,” Judith Brown framed the issue in these terms: The radical woman lives off-campus, away from her parents, and often openly with one man or another. She thinks this is ‘freedom.’ But if she shares a place with a man, she ‘plays marriage,’ which means that she cooks, cleans, does the laundry, and generally serves and waits. Hassles with parents or fear of the Dean of Women help to sustain the excitement—the romantic illusions about marriage she brought to the domicile. If she shares an apartment with other women, it is arranged so that each may entertain men for extended visits with maximum privacy. Often, for the women, these apartments become a kind of bordello; for the men, in addition to that, a good place to meet for political discussion, to put up campus travelers, to grab a free meal, or sack out.", "timestamp": ""}], "per_doc_notes": [{"doc_id": "d1", "verdict": "partially supports", "key_fact": "During the 1960s sexual revolution, women gained more control over their bodies and sexuality through the pill and feminist movements seeking liberation from social and moral confines.", "quote": "With the introduction of the pill and second-wave feminism, women gained more control over their bodies and sexuality during the 1960s.

It turned out that the portable electric chair had been improperly set up by an intoxicated prison guard and inmate.[42] A case was brought before the U.S. Supreme Court (Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber),[43] with lawyers for the condemned arguing that although Francis did not die, he had, in fact, been executed. The argument was rejected on the basis that re-execution did not violate the double jeopardy clause of the 5th Amendment of the United States Constitution, and Francis was returned to the electric chair and executed in 1947.[44] Florida saw three highly controversial botched electrocutions in the 1990s, starting with the 1990 execution of Jesse Tafero. His case generated significant controversy, as with the first administration of electricity, Tafero's face and head caught fire. Tafero's execution ultimately required three shocks over the course of seven minutes. The error was blamed on prison officials replacing Florida's old natural sea sponge with a kitchen sponge.[45] The 1997 execution of Pedro Medina in Florida created controversy when flames burst from his head. An autopsy found that Medina had died instantly when the first surge of electricity had destroyed his brain and brain stem. A judge ruled that the incident arose from \"unintentional human error\" rather than any faults in the \"apparatus, equipment, and electrical circuitry\" of Florida's electric chair.[46] In Florida, on July 8, 1999, Allen Lee Davis, convicted of murder, was executed in the Florida electric chair \"Old Sparky\".

The Nebraska Supreme Court’s ruling today that use of the electric chair violates the state constitution’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment is an important step toward eliminating inherently inhumane executions in the United States, Human Rights Watch said today. Nebraska is the only state to use the electric chair as its sole method of execution; all other US death penalty jurisdictions use lethal injection. “This ruling abolishes the barbaric practice of electrocutions in the state of Nebraska,” said Sarah Tofte, US researcher at Human Rights Watch and co-author of a 2006 report on executions by lethal injection in the United States. The Nebraska Supreme Court ruled today that execution by electrocution violates the ban on cruel and unusual punishment found in Article I, section 9 of the Nebraska Constitution. “Condemned prisoners must not be tortured to death, regardless of their crimes,” the court wrote. Since 1994, Nebraska has electrocuted three condemned prisoners.

As a result of today’s ruling, the task falls to the Nebraska legislature to consider an alternative method of execution if it wishes to retain the death penalty. Although the court contends that lethal injection “is universally recognized as the most humane method of execution,” Human Rights Watch urged the Nebraska legislature to carefully examine the risk of suffering posed by the three-drug protocol currently used in lethal injections in other states.

The method applies one or more high voltage electrical currents through electrodes attached to the head and legs of a condemned inmate, who sits strapped to a chair. A typical electrocution lasts about two minutes. Electrocution was first adopted in 1888 in New York as a quicker and more humane alternative to hanging. Two years later, on August 6, 1890, New York state initiated its electric chair, executing William Kemmler at Auburn State Prison; in 1899 Martha Place became the first woman to be electrocuted. Kemmler’s highly publicized execution was a grotesque and fiery botch. One New York Times reporter described the incident in detail, noting that it was “awful” and “the witnesses were so horrified by the ghastly sight that they could not take their eyes off it.” Kemmler’s face was bloody, his hair and skin scorched, and the death chamber’s “stench…unbearable.” According to the three doctors who conducted Kemmler’s autopsy, there was “[e]xtensive charring” of the body where the electrodes had been attached. Nevertheless, electrocution was soon adopted in other states and by its peak in 1949 was the method of execution in 26 states. The U.S. Supreme Court has never rendered a judgment as to whether electrocution violates the U.S. Constitution’s Eighth Amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. However, considerable evidence suggests that the method can inflict on the inmate unnecessary pain, indignity, and physical mutilation (e.g., severe external burning and bleeding). Documentation of witnessed executions has shown a substantial pattern of consecutive mishaps.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d10", "source_url": "https://press.princeton.edu/ideas/grave-consequences?srsltid=AfmBOorSygayZKCpNHh4ZQtQ-NexQaw0JyKQ4ZBrSM77KKCHg7VgnJ_A", "snippet": "Grave consequences | Princeton University Press Since 2018, five condemned Tennessee prisoners with the right to choose picked the electric chair. Why did they choose the electric chair? Thus, there are numerous dormant electric chairs in American prisons ready to be redeployed at a moment’s notice. With multiple challenges to the constitutionality of lethal injection anticipated to be working their way through the Federal court system in the wake of the Nance v. Ward decision, the prospect of an unconstitutionality ruling in the foreseeable future seems to be an increasing possibility. If such a ruling were to be handed down by the Supreme Court, the electric chair would, by default, once again become the dominant method of court-ordered execution in the United States, as it had been for over 100 years. The open question is whether a return to the electric chair would increase or decrease the suffering of the condemned. That is to say, is the electric chair even more cruel than lethal injection? The United States is the only country in the world that uses electrocution as a method to execute condemned prisoners. To date, there have been more that 4,300 electric chair executions in America, the last one in Tennessee in 2020. When it first made the scene in 1890, the electric chair was certainly an unusual punishment, but it was not thought to be cruel. In fact, the electric chair was specifically designed not to be cruel. Death by electrocution was believed to be quick and painless. Today, after 4,300 electrocutions, death by electric chair can no longer be called an unusual punishment. But is it, in fact, cruel? Our experience with earlier widespread use of electric chair tells us that death by electric chair isn’t always quick or painless. Unfortunately, most everything we know about the experience of death in the electric chair comes to us anecdotally and by trial and error; there have been no scientific studies of the possible pain and suffering associated with death by electric chair, although it has been assumed to be painless for a long time.

The ridership is expected to exceed 1.25 crore in a year or two. Here are some key highlights of India's metro rail system: Daily ridership across all metro rail systems has surpassed one crore. Over three-fourths of India's metro rail network has been conceptualised, constructed, and operationalised in less than a decade. The Delhi Metro is the largest, with an annual ridership of over 100 crores. Many commuters still prefer other modes of transport for short trips.

The FIBA Men's World Ranking, are FIBA's rankings of national basketball teams. FIBA ranks both men's and women's national teams for both senior and junior competitions. It also publishes combined rankings for all mixed-sex competitions. Not included are the rankings for three-on-three competitions, which are tabulated for individual players. The ranking system compares teams based on the weighted average rating points they earn in games over the last eight years. Teams earn a certain amount of rating points for each game based on the margin of victory/defeat, site of game and strength of opponent. Each game's rating points are then weighted by factors including the time of game, competition/region, competition stage and round reached. The ranking is currently sponsored by Nike; as such, the names Nike FIBA World Ranking or FIBA World Ranking Men, presented by Nike is also used.[2][3] History In its previous ranking system before October 2017, FIBA used a competition-based system which awarded points based on the final standings of FIBA final tournaments.[4] The system weighted all results within the eight-year period equally and did not consider the results of qualifiers for tournaments.[3][5] Until the 2016 Olympic Games, the Olympics and the men's world championship gave 5 points each toward the ranking. Since the new FIBA ranking system was launched, these two tournaments had their score devalued to 2.5 points for playing in a World championship, and 2 points for playing in an Olympic game since 2017. Calculation Only FIBA tournaments consisting of full five-a-side teams are used in calculations for the rankings. Other tournaments, such as regional championships, invitationals, three-on-three half-court basketball, and friendlies are not included. On October 11, 2017, FIBA radically changed its ranking system for men's national teams when Nike became FIBA's strategic partner. The changes saw the ranking system switching from the previous competition-based system to a game-based system.[5][6]", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d3", "source_url": "https://olympics.com/en/news/fiba-men-basketball-world-ranking-complete-list", "snippet": "FIBA men's basketball world ranking: Complete list - Olympics.com FIBA Men's Basketball World Rankings ahead of 2023 World Cup ; 1.

Share this article While we are still a few weeks away from the 2024 Paris Olympics, we now know which 12 teams will actually compete for a chance to win gold. Seven teams, including USA and Canada, qualified for the 2024 Olympics in Paris based on their performance at the 2023 FIBA World Cup. France earned qualification as a host nation, bumping that number up to eight. 24 additional countries competed for the final spots in Olympic competition during four qualifying tournaments. The winners were Spain, Greece, Brazil, and Puerto Rico and all will advance to play during the Olympics. Some of the most notable nations who will not compete in Paris include Latvia, Argentina, Lithuania, Slovenia, Italy, and Poland. 12 South Sudan The biggest underdog to appear in the Olympics is South Sudan, who earned a qualification during the 2023 FIBA World Cup. They saw fantastic games from Carlik Jones (a former NBA guard who played in China last season) and Wenyen Gabriel (who played in the NBA from 2018 until last year) during the tournament.

That makes them the biggest wild card of the Games. The FIBA World Rankings are high on Spain, ranking them second as of late February. A core led by international veterans with NBA experience (Rudy Fernandez) paired with rising international talent (Usman Garuba and Santi Aldama) should do well against Group A competition. A run to the medal round is certainly possible, but the difficulty of their group could see the Spaniards sink to fourth if their inconsistent form returns. 5. Canada The golden generation of Canadian basketball has arrived, as America's neighbors to the north have begun producing NBA talent in spades. A bronze medal at the 2023 FIBA World Cup punched Canada's first Olympic ticket since 2000, and they have all the talent necessary to go on another run to the medal round here as well. MVP candidate Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is the star for Team Canada, which also features versatile weapons like Lu Dort, Jamal Murray, R.J. Barrett, Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Dillon Brooks. While post play may not be a strength for the Canadians, their capability on the wings and ability to put the ball in the basket gives them an excellent chance to finish inside the top two of the rugged Group A. 4.

Stephen King is an American author of horror, supernatural fiction, suspense, science fiction, and fantasy. He has published over 60 novels and over 200 short stories throughout his career, many of which have been adapted into films or TV series. Stephen King’s books often focus on themes such as alienation, violence, and the struggle between good and evil. What should be the first Stephen King book to read? I personally recommend that you start with Salem’s Lot. In the novel, Ben Mears returns to Jerusalem’s Lot in hopes that exploring the history of the Marsten House, an old mansion long the subject of rumor and speculation, will help him cast out his personal devils and provide inspiration for his new book. For beginners, I think it’s a great place to start and a personal favorite. I also shared my Salem’s Lot 2024 adaptation review that you can read or watch, plus the differences between the Salem’s Lot movie vs book.

Simple as that. ” Stephen King Famous for his terrifying prose, King writes horror, supernatural, science fiction, fantasy and, more recently, crime novels. When asked why he writes, King responds: “The answer to that is fairly simple — there was nothing else I was made to do. I was made to write stories and I love to write stories. That’s why I do it. I really can’t imagine doing anything else and I can’t imagine not doing what I do.” Having penned over 200 short stories – many set in his home town of Maine and the most famous arguably being his novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the basis for the movie The Shawshank Redemption – it was no surprise when he was awarded a National Medal of Arts from the United States National Endowment for the Arts for his contributions to literature in 2015.

Throughout the early years of his marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other anthologies. In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories and to work on novels. In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time. At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age of 59. Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado. Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder.

Since the publication of his first novel, Carrie, fifty years ago, King has held dominion over the landscape of horror. He arrived during a resurgent interest in all things frightening–following the success of Ira Levin’s Rosemary’s Baby (1967) and William Peter Blatty’s The Exorcist (1971)—and quickly set about reshaping the genre in his own image. King has regularly published two or three books per year, a stream of words flowing incessantly west toward Hollywood. Almost everything he has ever written has been optioned or adapted for the screen, in some cases several times. Such prolificacy has often led to sniffing criticism from those who consider him “merely” a horror writer (as if horror is anything “mere”). But for millions of readers and writers, he is our North Star, our Southern Cross. We navigate by him. I have interviewed hundreds of horror writers from all across the genre’s wide spectrum, and when asked for their inspirations and their gateways to fearful fiction, so many leap immediately to King. Nat Cassidy, author of 2022’s Mary: An Awakening of Terror, put it best, describing King as his “mother tongue.” He is not just a writer; he is an industry, an aesthetic, a genre of one. Of course, in so long and varied a career, there are exhilarating highs, a few bewildering lows, and many unexpected diversions. The following list is an attempt to rank King’s published work in all its darkness, weatherworn beauty, and surprising weirdness.

The idea of adding chlorine to public drinking systems first gained traction around the end of the 19th century. People had long battled a variety of ailments that were spread through water, including diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid. When scientists recognized that adding chlorine in small amounts to drinking water could kill bacteria and microbes in the public water system and help slow or even stop the spread of these water-borne diseases, the idea of adding chlorine to water supplies became popular quickly. In 1897, Maidstone, England became the first town to have its water supply entirely treated with chlorine. Soon after, the idea spread to the United States, finding its place in local water systems and even gaining popularity in the U.S. military. Today, chlorination is the most common water treatment method worldwide, particularly in the U.S. where it’s used heavily. What are the harmful effects of chlorine for you and your family? The shadow side of chlorinated water is becoming more apparent all the time. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, Americans now are consuming 300-600 times the amount of chlorine that is safe to ingest. Why is chlorine in drinking water dangerous? Because when chlorine mixes with even minute amounts of organic compounds that are very often found in water, harmful by-products, called Trihalomethanes (THMs) are produced. These by-products produce free radicals in the body, which trigger cell damage — and are highly carcinogenic, even in small amounts. As scientists have looked into the potentially dangerous effects of chlorine, use of the chemical has been linked to a wide range of ailments, including various cancers, reproductive problems, problems with the immune system, and heart attacks. Here is some of the research showing the harmful effects of consuming chlorine in water: In the small town of Roseto, Pennsylvania, after changing from drinking mountain spring water to drinking chlorinated tap water, the population went from having no heart attacks to having heart attacks, with no changes to their diets.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d2", "source_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_chlorination", "snippet": "Water chlorination - Wikipedia The technique of purification of drinking water by use of compressed liquefied chlorine gas was developed by a British officer in the Indian Medical Service, ... History In a paper published in 1894, it was formally proposed to add chlorine to water to render it \"germ-free\". Two other authorities endorsed this proposal and published it in many other papers in 1895.[4] Early attempts at implementing water chlorination at a water treatment plant were made in 1893 in Hamburg, Germany. In 1897 the town of Maidstone, England was the first to have its entire water supply treated with chlorine.[5] Permanent water chlorination began in 1905, when a faulty slow sand filter and a contaminated water supply caused a serious typhoid fever epidemic in Lincoln, England.[6] Alexander Cruickshank Houston used chlorination of the water to stop the epidemic. His installation fed a concentrated solution of so-called \"chlorinated lime\" (a mixture of calcium hypochlorite, calcium hydroxide and calcium chloride) to the water being treated. This was not simply modern calcium chloride, but contained chlorine gas dissolved in lime-water (dilute calcium hydroxide) to form calcium hypochlorite (chlorinated lime). The chlorination of the water supply helped stop the epidemic and as a precaution, the chlorination was continued until 1911 when a new water supply was commissioned.[7] Manual Control Chlorinator for the liquefaction of chlorine for water purification, early 20th century.

The first continuous use of chlorine in the United States for disinfection took place in 1908 at Boonton Reservoir (on the Rockaway River), which served as the supply for Jersey City, New Jersey.[8] Chlorination was achieved by controlled additions of dilute solutions of chloride of lime (calcium hypochlorite) at doses of 0.2 to 0.35 ppm.

Chloramines are a group of chemical compounds that contain chlorine and ammonia. The type of chloramine used to kill germs in drinking water is called monochloramine. Disinfection byproducts are chemicals made when chlorine or chloramine come into contact with dirt or other materials in water. At high enough levels, disinfection byproducts can cause health problems over time. How it works To prevent illnesses, utilities must meet water quality standards. These standards include rules about the levels of germs, disinfectants, and disinfection byproducts that can be in public tap water. Following these rules, utilities add low levels of chlorine or chloramine to kill germs during water treatment. Safe levels of chlorine and chloramine Chlorine or chloramine levels up to 4 milligrams per liter (mg/L), or 4 parts per million (ppm), are considered safe in drinking water. These low levels kill harmful germs and are unlikely to make people sick. Why utilities switch disinfectants Both chlorine and chloramine are good at killing germs in water. However, each has certain benefits and drawbacks, so utilities sometimes switch between them. Switching to chlorine Water pipes can grow a slimy layer of germs (called a biofilm). This layer helps protect the germs from being killed by disinfectants. Utilities may temporarily switch from chloramine to chlorine disinfection to help remove this slime layer. Switching to chloramine Chlorine gets used up quickly in water.

Contact Info Drinking Water Chlorination: Frequently Asked Questions What is drinking water chlorination? Drinking water chlorination is the addition of chlorine to drinking water systems. It is the most common type of drinking water disinfection. Disinfection kills bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms that cause disease and immediate illness. Chlorine is effective and continues to keep the water safe as it travels from the treatment plant to the consumer's tap. A little over 100 years ago, waterborne diseases like typhoid fever and dysentery were a common part of life in the United States —and a common cause of death, too. In the early 1900s, cities started disinfecting drinking water supplies to kill bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms. Both the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regard disinfection of drinking water as one of the most important advances in public health. Is drinking water chlorination required? Chlorination or other continuous disinfection (disinfection that protects from the treatment plant to the consumer’s tap) is required for public water systems that: Use surface water, such as rivers, lakes, and streams, as their source; Have treatment processes that expose the water to outside or open air; or Add treatment chemicals for corrosion control; these chemicals can feed microorganisms and cause them to grow. Disinfection is recommended but not required for other community public water systems. Is chlorinated water safe to drink? Yes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limits the amount of chlorine in drinking water to levels that are safe for human consumption. The levels of chlorine used for drinking water disinfection are unlikely to cause long-term health effects. During water treatment, chlorine can combine with naturally occurring organic matter in the water to form compounds called disinfection byproducts (DBPs).

By the 1920s, thousands of cities worldwide were ... Drinking Water Chlorination Facts What is chlorine? Chlorine is a common element in nature, where it is usually combined with other elements. The largest amount of chlorine on earth is in the oceans as sodium chloride or salt. Salt and water are the most common ingredients used to manufacture the chlorine used in your drinking water. Why is chlorine added to drinking water? Chlorine is a versatile disinfectant that kills many types of bacteria, viruses and parasites (pathogens) that cause water-borne infections. Some water-borne infections can cause severe illness and even death. Water suppliers add chlorine disinfectants to drinking water to protect public health. For more information on water-borne infections, see HealthLinkBC File #49a Water-borne Infections in British Columbia. How long has chlorine been used to disinfect water? Chlorine disinfectants were first added to a public water supply in North America in 1908. By the 1920s, thousands of cities worldwide were using chlorine disinfectants to treat drinking water. There was a drastic reduction in water-borne infections, such as typhoid fever and cholera. Infant mortality also declined. Most cities or towns in Canada use chlorine disinfectants to treat drinking water. How is chlorine added to my drinking water? There are many different chlorine disinfectant products and each is added to water using a different approach. These products can be a solid, liquid or gas, but once added to water they all work in a similar way. For this reason they all get the generic labeling of “chlorine.” Your water supplier chooses the product used in your drinking water based on many factors such as cost, source water, size of the water system and whether other forms of treatment are needed. What is secondary disinfection? After being disinfected, water travels through the distribution system to your home through a network of pipes. In some cases, pipes can leak or break and contaminate the water.", "timestamp": "2022-06-14"}, {"doc_id": "d8", "source_url": "https://www.sthelensoregon.gov/dwff/page/why-there-chlorine-my-drinking-water", "snippet": "Why is there Chlorine in my Drinking Water? | City of St Helens Oregon (In 1908, Chicago and Jersey City were the first cities in the U.S. to begin routinely treating drinking water with chlorine.)

It led to a significant reduction in waterborne diseases ... Celebrating 115 Years of Safe Drinking Water Today, on September 26, 2023, we celebrate a historic milestone: the 115th anniversary of continuous chlorine disinfection in U.S. public water supplies. This momentous event, which transformed American public health, unfolded in Jersey City, New Jersey. Safe, accessible drinking water, made possible through water treatment, is often taken for granted. However, this achievement didn't happen overnight and traces back to Jersey City. In the early 1900s, using chlorine to treat drinking water was groundbreaking. It led to a significant reduction in waterborne diseases, with Dr. John L. Leal playing a crucial role. Jersey City faced high rates of waterborne diseases, especially among children. Dr. Leal, a physician and health officer, proposed adding a small amount of \"chloride of lime\" to drinking water, a revolutionary idea. High-profile court cases paved the way for Dr. Leal and engineer George Warren Fuller to put this concept to the test. By 1914, 53% of U.S. public water supplies used chlorinated water. While we celebrate this achievement, we must remember that the battle for clean water continues. @WHO reports 361,000 children under 5 die annually due to inadequate access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene. Let's join UN in pursuing Sustainable Development Goal 6—clean water and sanitation for all, a crucial step toward other SDGs.

It was built around 983 CE during the Western Ganga dynasty and is one of the largest free-standing statues in the world.[3] It was regarded the tallest Jain statue until 2016.[4] The construction of the statue was commissioned by the Ganga dynasty minister and commander Chavundaraya. Neighbouring areas have Jain temples known as basadis and several images of the Tirthankaras. Vindyagiri Hill is one of the two hills in Shravanabelagola. The other is Chandragiri, which is also a seat of several ancient Jain centres, much older than Gommateshwara statue.

Thus, it’s best not to supplement unless it’s truly necessary (50). Summary Vegans not getting enough iron from their diets should consider fortified foods or a supplement. However, overly high levels can be harmful, and iron supplements are not recommended for everyone. However, studies tend to agree that most vegans don’t get enough calcium (52, 53). An often-heard remark among the vegan community is that vegans have lower calcium needs than omnivores because they do not use this mineral to neutralize the acidity produced by a meat-rich diet. More research is needed to evaluate how meatless diets affect daily calcium requirements. However, evidence suggests that vegans consuming less than 525 mg of calcium tend to have an increased risk of bone fractures (53). For this reason, all vegans are encouraged to aim for the RDA, making sure they consume at least 525 mg of calcium per day. Supplements should be used if this can’t be achieved through diet or fortified foods alone. Summary Vegans consuming too little dietary calcium should consider taking a daily supplement. This is especially important for those getting less than 525 mg per day. Zinc is a mineral that’s crucial for metabolism, immune function, and the repair of body cells. An insufficient intake of zinc can lead to developmental problems, hair loss, diarrhea, and delayed wound healing. The RDA for zinc is currently set at 8–11 mg per day for adults. It increases to 11–12 mg for pregnant women and 12–13 mg for lactating women (54). Few plant foods contain high amounts of zinc.

Leafy greens several times a week? Foods fortified with vitamin B12? (Check the Nutrition Facts label to see). If not, you need to take a vitamin B12 supplement. Foods fortified with vegan vitamin D3 (or spending time in the sun every day)? If not, you probably need to take a vitamin D supplement. Take Your Vegan Vitamins! While vitamins can be a great way to make sure you’re hitting all your nutritional needs, beware—not all vitamins are vegan. Some vitamins are animal-derived, and others contain animal products such as gelatin (which comes from animal skin and bones). Of course, there are many vegan vitamins out there! Naturelo is a great natural supplement brand that offers many fully-vegan vitamins that are gelatin-free.

If relying on fortified foods, check the labels carefully to make sure you are getting enough B12. For example, if a fortified plant milk contains 1 microgram of B12 per serving then consuming three servings a day will provide adequate vitamin B12. Others may find the use of B12 supplements more convenient and economical. The less frequently you obtain B12 the more B12 you need to take, as B12 is best absorbed in small amounts. The recommendations above take full account of this. There is no harm in exceeding the recommended amounts or combining more than one option. Good information supports vegan health, pass it around.

It is required in smaller amounts than any other known vitamin. Ten micrograms of B12 spread over a day appears to supply as much as the body can use. In the absence of any apparent dietary supply, deficiency symptoms usually take five years or more to develop in adults, though some people experience problems within a year. A very small number of individuals with no obvious reliable source appear to avoid clinical deficiency symptoms for twenty years or more.

All these statements identify vitamin B12 deficiency as a risk to health and wellbeing in both vegetarian and vegan diets and clearly state that adopting such diets, especially a vegan diet, requires adequate planning and continuous monitoring. Among the statements, Spain and Germany adopt the most conservative position, in particular warning against adherence to vegan diets in children. The UK statement is less explicit, which is in line with the general UK approach to recommendations for B12 (see later). Nonetheless, they all emphasise proper dietary planning and regular monitoring as being a sensible precaution. In agreement with the statements, we highlight the need to seek expert advice on how to carefully plan and implement a healthful vegan diet. Vegan diet in health and disease Regarding vitamin B12, we believe a cautionary note and further clarity is required to accompany the health benefits associated with plant-based diets, with particular attention to vegan diets. Vegetarian and vegan diets are associated with beneficial effects on the blood lipid profile and a reduced risk of negative health outcomes, including diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and cancer risk [19]. While it is commonly recognised that a healthy vegan diet is associated with better general health, independent studies on all-cause mortality have yielded contrasting results [20–23]. Notably, there is increased risk of micronutrient deficiencies within an unsupplemented vegan diet, potentially offsetting any health benefits; however, more comprehensive studies are required to establish this relationship [13, 24–27]. Specifically, an unsupplemented diet lacks adequate amounts of a number of micronutrients and minerals that are insufficiently found in plants or may have low(er) bioavailability.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d5", "source_url": "https://www.todaysdietitian.com/newarchives/0418p38.shtml", "snippet": "Vitamin B12 and the Vegan Diet - Today's Dietitian Magazine Experts weigh in on nutrition recommendations for this essential micronutrient that has been a source of confusion for vegan consumers. \"Vegans can get vitamin B12 through natural bacteria in their mouths. \" \"It's a myth that vegans need to take vitamin B12 supplements. \" \"You can get enough B12 from the soil on your vegetables if you don't wash them. \" These are just three of the common myths floating around the plant-based community surrounding vitamin B12 intake and vegan diets. In fact, some popular vegan websites and publications hold the philosophy that vegans can meet all of their essential nutrient needs without the use of any supplements. To be sure, this viewpoint isn't prevalent among all plant-based experts and websites. Most respected sources place great emphasis on supplementing the vegan diet with adequate B12 sources.

For an adequate vitamin B12 supply, vegans rely on regular use of fortified foods or supplements. Vegetarians can obtain vitamin B12 from dairy and eggs but may also benefit from fortified foods or supplemental vitamin B12 when intake of animal-based foods is limited. Vitamin D is naturally present only in a few foods, particularly fatty fish, eggs, meat, mushrooms treated with UV-light and algae [71], which explains why highest vitamin D intakes were seen in pesco-vegetarians with regular fish consumption. However, mean vitamin D intakes (also when intake from supplements was considered) were far below the EAR in all dietary patterns and therefore vitamin D fortified foods or supplements are generally recommended [72]. While vitamin D can also be synthesized in the skin upon exposure to sunlight, this may be insufficient during winter in areas of higher latitude (around > 40 °N, e.g., Madrid, Beijing) and for people with dark skin or limited sun exposure [72], as illustrated by the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in a small study among Finnish vegans and vegetarians (67% and 33%) [46]. Calcium intake was lower in vegans compared to vegetarians and meat-eaters. However, for all dietary patterns, one third or more of studies reported intakes below the EAR, suggesting that inadequate intakes may occur in the general population.

Two types of iron are found in food: heme (animal-derived) and non-heme (plant-derived).Â Although it can be taken as a supplement, enough iron is available in our dietary sources. Â Vegans can find non-heme iron in dried beans and legumes, dark green leafy vegetables, dried fruits, nuts and seeds, and wholegrain cereals and breads. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to all parts of the body. Myoglobin, another protein made by iron, brings oxygen to your muscles. Â Why You Need Iron Your body needs iron to function properly. Too little will lead to an iron deficiency. Too much can cause iron poisoning. The average amount of iron a vegan needs is 32 milligrams per day for women and 14 milligrams per day for men. Vegans need up to 1.8 times more iron than people who eat meat. Â Iron plays an important part in proper bodily functions, including:Â Blood Production Health Iron is found in red blood cells called hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in your blood from your lungs to your tissues. This improves your heart health, respiratory functions, and immune function. Â Physical Health Your skin, hair, and nails appear stronger and healthier due to the synthesis of collagen, a protein needed for joint and skin health. Collagen is made by iron, a component of the enzymes essential for proper production. Iron is found in muscle cells. Called myoglobin, it helps muscles accept, store, and transport oxygen. Â Mental Health Iron makes up certain proteins essential for energy metabolism. The right amount of iron improves general energy and increases focus. Â Low levels of iron can lead to an iron deficiency called anemia.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d8", "source_url": "https://www.webmd.com/diet/vegan-diet-overview", "snippet": "Vegan Diet - Foods You Can and Cannot Eat, Benefits and Risks Better weight control may be one reason for all of these health benefits. Vegans have a lower body mass index (BMI) than people who eat animal-based products. Good nutrition is another perk. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and nuts are staples of the vegan diet. These foods are rich in fiber, antioxidants, and compounds that help protect against diseases like diabetes and cancer. Risks A vegan diet is healthy overall, but avoiding animal protein can shortchange you on a few nutrients, like protein, calcium, omega-3 fatty acids, zinc,Â vitamin B12, and vitamin D. You need protein to power all the chemical reactions in your body. Calcium strengthens your bones and teeth. Omega-3 fatty acids keep your cells healthy and protect your heart by shielding against heart disease and stroke. These nutrients are especially important for children's growing bodies and for pregnant women. You can find substitutes for most of these essential nutrients in plant-based foods like: One nutrient that's impossible to get from plant sources alone is vitamin B12, which your body uses to make red blood cells and DNA. You'll only find B12 in animal products. If you go vegan, you may need a supplement to make up for what you don't get from your diet. Keep in mind that a vegan diet is only as healthy as you make it. Products like \"vegan\" ice cream, cookies, and candy are tempting, but you don't want to overdo. If you eat high-fat and processed foods and supersize your portions, you'll gain weight and might end up with many of the same health problems you'd have on a meat-based diet. How to Go Vegan Does the idea of a vegan diet interest you, but you're not sure how to start? If you want, you could plunge right in and cut out all poultry, meat, eggs, and dairy at once.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d9", "source_url": "https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/7-nutrients-you-cant-get-from-plants", "snippet": "7 Nutrients You Can't Get from Plants Dieting on plant-based foods alone may skip out on some important nutrients like vitamins B12 and D3. Supplementing these in your diet will ensure you’re getting everything your body needs to maintain health. Vegan and vegetarian diets are both very healthy ways of eating. They’ve been linked to multiple health benefits and a lower risk of excess weight, heart disease, and even some types of cancer. However, a few nutrients are either difficult or impossible to get in adequate amounts from plant foods alone. That’s why it’s very important to be aware them and supplement your diet to maintain health or physical performance. Some of these effects are stronger in people on a vegetarian diet than in meat eaters. For instance, vegetarians taking creatine supplements may experience significant improvements in brain function while people who eat meat see no difference (31). This may be attributed to the meat eaters already having higher levels of creatine in their muscles as a result of their diet. You can purchase vegan-friendly creatine supplements locally or online. Summary Creatine is a bioactive compound that’s lacking in plant-based diets. It plays an important role in brain and muscle function. Vegan vitamin D3 supplements made from lichen are also available (61). Summary Cholecalciferol (D3) is a type of vitamin D found in animal-sourced foods, especially fatty fish, and it’s more effective at raising blood levels of vitamin D than the plant form of vitamin D (D2). Vegan vitamin D3 supplements can be purchased online. DHA is an essential omega-3 fatty acid that’s important for normal brain development and function (62). Deficiency in DHA can have adverse effects on mental health and brain function, especially in children (63, 64). In addition, inadequate DHA intake in pregnant women may adversely affect fetal brain development (65). It’s mainly found in fatty fish, fish oil, and certain types of microalgae.

They were subsequently asked to alter the song to give it a \"Stevie Wonder feel\".[1] The writers previously had the opportunity to work with famous performers like dubbing artist Marni Nixon, though were \"excited and astonished\" to work with Wonder.[1] Wilder recalled: \"While sitting in the studio waiting for Wonder's arrival, some guy walks in and sets up a keyboard and then walks out with saying a word.

He looked like an African god. \"[1] Wilder and Zippel didn't have a clear collaboration in mind when calling Wonder into the studio. Initially they had asked him to play harmonica on the track. Wonder said that he liked the song, describing it as \"a song I would've written back in the '70s and I’m into it\" and offered to sing on it.[1] Meanwhile, 98 Degrees had recently released their debut album with just one single \"Invisible Man\" and the album failed to chart. The band's next creative step following this was to explore the international markets of Asia and Europe and record \"True to Your Heart\" with Stevie Wonder for Disney's Mulan soundtrack which led them to wider recognition.[2] Critical reception MTV described it as a \"celebratory tune that captures the mood of the film's conclusion\" a la \"Circle of Life\".[3] Soundtrack.net felt the song \"seems very out of place on this soundtrack\".[9] NPO3FM deemed the song the \"big breakthrough\" of 98 Degrees.[10]DVDDizzy deemed it \"catchy but out-of-left-field\" and a \"soundtrack anomaly\", though added that the music video does a \"good job at inspiring laughter\".[7] CinemaBlend felt the singers were \"crooning\" in the song.[11]Billboard deemed it the 22nd", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d2", "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Dl7QtNXqg", "snippet": "True To Your Heart - YouTube Provided to YouTube by Universal Music Group True To Your Heart · 98º · Stevie Wonder Mulan ℗ 1998 Walt Disney Records Released on: ...", "timestamp": "2018-07-31"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXELi5NARo", "snippet": "98° & Stevie Wonder - True To Your Heart (Official Music Video) Music video 98° & Stevie Wonder performing True To Your Heart.

A US team at the University of Pennsylvania scanned the brains of nearly 1,000 men, women, boys and girls and found striking differences. Image caption, The \"connectome maps\" reveal the differences between the male brain (seen in blue) and the female brain (orange) Male brains appeared to be wired front to back, with few connections bridging the two hemispheres. In females, the pathways criss-crossed between left and right. These differences might explain why men, in general, tend to be better at learning and performing a single task, like cycling or navigating, whereas women are more equipped for multitasking, say the researchers in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). The same volunteers were asked to perform a series of cognitive tests, and the results appeared to support this notion. But experts have questioned whether it can be that simple, arguing it is a huge leap to extrapolate from anatomical differences to try to explain behavioural variation between the sexes.

Ragini Verma, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, said the greatest surprise was how much the findings supported old stereotypes, with men's brains apparently wired more for perception and co-ordinated actions, and women's for social skills and memory, making them better equipped for multitasking. \"If you look at functional studies, the left of the brain is more for logical thinking, the right of the brain is for more intuitive thinking. So if there's a task that involves doing both of those things, it would seem that women are hardwired to do those better,\" Verma said. \"Women are better at intuitive thinking. Women are better at remembering things.

Women’s, men’s brains respond differently to hungry infant’s cries Researchers at the National Institutes of Health have uncovered firm evidence for what many mothers have long suspected: women’s brains appear to be hard-wired to respond to the cries of a hungry infant. Researchers asked men and women to let their minds wander, then played a recording of white noise interspersed with the sounds of an infant crying. Brain scans showed that, in the women, patterns of brain activity abruptly switched to an attentive mode when they heard the infant cries, whereas the men’s brains remained in the resting state. “Previous studies have shown that, on an emotional level, men and women respond differently to the sound of an infant crying,” said study co-author Marc H. Bornstein, Ph.D., head of the Child and Family Research Section of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the institute that conducted the study. “Our findings indicate that men and women show marked differences in terms of attention as well.” The earlier studies showed that women are more likely than men to feel sympathy when they hear an infant cry, and are more likely to want to care for the infant. Dr. Bornstein collaborated with Nicola De Pisapia, Ph.D., Paola Rigo, Simona DeFalco, Ph.D., and Paola Venuti, Ph.D., all of the Observation, Diagnosis and Education Lab at the University of Trento, Italy, and Gianluca Esposito, Ph.D., of RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Japan. Previous studies have shown differences in patterns of brain activity between when an individual’s attention is focused and when the mind wanders. The pattern of unfocused activity is referred to as default mode, Dr. Bornstein explained. When individuals focus on something in particular, their brains disengage from the default mode and activate other brain networks. For about 15 minutes, participants listened to white noise interspersed with short periods of silence and with the sounds of a hungry infant crying. The patterns of their brain activity were recorded by a technique known as functional magnetic resonance imaging.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d4", "source_url": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/so-happy-together/201904/male-and-female-brains", "snippet": "Male and Female Brains | Psychology Today Male and Female Brains Are they wired differently? In a previous article, we talked about how men and women have distinct perspectives and often approach and interpret events differently. It's not that one is better than the other; they’re just different. This is certainly no earth-shattering revelation. Just to continue on this theme, we decided to take a look at the research as to what might be underlying these differences. There's a debate going on in the scientific community as to whether or not the unique characteristics of men and women have a physiological basis. The male brain is about 10 percent larger on average, but size doesn't matter here. After all, elephants have brains that are three times larger and have more neurons than humans, but we don't see them doing brain surgery, and it's not just because they don't have fingers. Some researchers argue that the brains of men and women are wired differently. The male brain is wired from front to back, with few connections across the two hemispheres. Women, on the other hand, have more wiring from left to right, so the two hemispheres are more inter-connected. Without getting into the neurological details, researchers propose that these wiring differences result in men and women having different strengths. So, while we mentioned that one sex is not better than the other overall, each is better, on average, in certain respects. Here are some of the findings: Men are better at performing single tasks; women are better at multi-tasking. Women are better at fine-motor coordination and retrieving information from long-term memory Women are more oriented toward and have better memories of faces, men of things. Men are better at visualizing a two- or three-dimensional shape rotated in space, at correctly determining angles from the horizontal, at tracking moving objects, and at aiming projectiles. In finding their way, men rely more on dead reckoning – that is, they determine their position from the direction and distance traveled. Women tend to rely more on landmarks. Unfortunately, there are also gender-specific tendencies that are not so good. Women are more prone to experience depression and post-traumaticstress disorder.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d5", "source_url": "https://www.healthline.com/health-news/mental-mens-and-womens-brains-wired-differently-120713", "snippet": "Men's and Women's Brains Are Wired Differently, But What Does It Using a relatively new technique called diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) on 949 young people, the team was able to track how different regions of their brains wire up with each other, and how large each connection is. The brain is split into two halves, called hemispheres. Verma’s study found that men have more connections within each hemisphere of the cerebrum, linking the regions for planning and decision-making with the regions for sight and speech. Women, on the other hand, have more connections between each hemisphere, allowing the two halves of the brain to share information more easily. In the cerebellum, the brain’s physics and motion calculator, the opposite was true—men had more connections between the two hemispheres, and women had more connections within each hemisphere. The study found minimal gender differences in children under the age of 13, but the differences were much more distinct by age 17. Many brain wiring changes occur during puberty, and men and women seem to develop differently. Verma seems to think these differences are significant. “These maps show us a stark difference in the architecture of the human brain that helps provide a potential neural basis as to why men excel at certain tasks, and women at others,” said Verma in a press release. According to the study, greater connectivity within hemispheres would make men better at performing single, focused tasks, while women’s connections between hemispheres would make them better at analysis, reasoning, and multitasking. This notion is supported by a previous study performed on a group of 3500 people ages eight to 21, which included the 949 individuals used for Verma’s study. It found that women performed better at attention, word and facial memory, and social tasks. Men, on the other hand, performed better at spatial processing and hand-eye coordination tasks. Interestingly, the differences were largest in kids ages 12 to 14, right on the cusp of puberty. By age 21, the differences were smaller.

Researchers say the differences could explain why the sexes seem more suited to certain types of tasks than their counterparts. For example, women seem to be hardwired for multitasking. Using imaging techniques, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania found men tended to display neural activity in one hemisphere of the brain for certain activities, while in women the activity bounces across hemispheres. “These maps show us a stark difference - and complementarity - in the architecture of the human brain that helps provide a potential neural basis as to why men excel at certain tasks, and women at others,” said Ragini Verma, PhD, an associate professor in the department of Radiology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. The study shows that, on average, men are more likely better at learning and performing a single task at hand, like cycling or navigating directions, whereas women have superior memory and social cognition skills, making them more equipped for multitasking and creating solutions that work for a group.

Arabian polytheism, the dominant form of religion, was based on veneration of deities and spirits. Worship was directed to various gods and goddesses, including Hubal and the goddesses al-Lāt, al-‘Uzzā, and Manāt, at local shrines and temples such as the Kaaba in Mecca. Deities were venerated and invoked through a variety of rituals, including pilgrimages and divination, as well as ritual sacrifice. Different theories have been proposed regarding the role of Allah in Meccan religion. Many of the physical descriptions of the pre-Islamic gods are traced to idols, especially near the Kaaba, which is said to have contained up to 360 of them. Until about the fourth century, almost all inhabitants of Arabia practiced polytheistic religions at which point pre-Islamic Arabian monotheism had begun to spread.[1] From the fourth to sixth centuries, Jewish, Christian, and other monotheistic populations developed. Until recent decades, it was believed that polytheism remained the dominant belief system in pre-Islamic Arabia,[2] but recent trends suggest that henotheism or monotheism was dominant from the fourth century onwards.[3][4][5] The contemporary sources of information regarding the pre-Islamic Arabian religion and pantheon include a growing number of inscriptions in carvings written in Arabian scripts like Safaitic, Sabaic, and Paleo-Arabic,[6] pre-Islamic poetry, external sources such as Jewish and Greek accounts, as well as the Muslim tradition, such as the Qur'an and Islamic writings. Nevertheless, information is limited.[6] According to the Book of Idols, descendants of the son of Abraham (Ishmael) who had settled in Mecca migrated to other lands carried holy stones from the Kaaba with them, erected them, and circumambulated them like the Kaaba.[12] This, according to al-Kalbi led to the rise of idol worship.[12] Based on this, it may be probable that Arabs originally venerated stones, later adopting idol-worship under foreign influences.[12]", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d2", "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5zwq4t/what_waswere_the_religions_before_islam_in_north/", "snippet": "What was(were) the religion(s) before Islam in North Africa ... - Reddit The polytheism of the Arabian Peninsula pre-Islam was a mix of Christianity, Judaism, and local polytheistic beliefs (idol worship, etc).", "timestamp": "2017-03-17"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "source_url": "https://www.quora.com/What-religion-was-followed-by-Muslims-before-Islam-as-it-was-created-in-609-AD-Is-it-true-that-all-Muslims-had-different-religions", "snippet": "What religion was followed by Muslims before Islam, as it ... - Quora Roughly most of them were either pagans, polytheists or on Abrahams religion or were Christians.

What Religion Existed Before Islam? Question Was there a religion called Islam before the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came? Summary of answer 1- With the general meaning of the word “Islam” in mind, it is correct to say that there was a religion called Islam before Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) was sent. 2- With regard to Islam in a specific sense, this is the religion with which Allah sent His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him). So, it is not correct to say that there was a religion called Islam before the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) was sent. Answer General meaning of Islam It should be noted that the word “Islam ” may refer to two things: a general meaning and a specific meaning. Islam in a general sense means submitting to Allah Alone, which implies worshipping Him Alone and obeying Him Alone. Everyone who believes in Allah Alone and worships Him according to His laws that have not been abrogated is a Muslim. Shaykh al-Islam said in al-Tadmuriyyah, p. 168-170: “This religion is the religion of Islam , besides which Allah will accept no other religion, either from the earlier or the later generations. All the Prophets followed Islam. Allah says of Nuh (interpretation of the meaning): “And recite to them the news of Nuh (Noah). When he said to his people: ‘O my people, if my stay (with you), and my reminding (you) of the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah is hard on you, then I put my trust in Allah.

Indeed, the earliest traditions concerning the Kaaba claim that inside its walls was a pit, dug into the sand, which contained \"treasures\" magically guarded by a snake. It is also possible that the original sanctuary held some cosmological significance for the ancient Arabs. Not only were many of the idols in the Kaaba associated with the planets and stars, but the legend that they totaled three hundred sixty in number suggests astral connotations. The seven circumambulations of the Kaaba-called tawaf in Arabic and still the primary ritual of the annual Hajj pilgrimage-may have been intended to mimic the motion of the heavenly bodies. It was, after all, a common belief among ancient peoples that their temples and sanctuaries were terrestrial replicas of the cosmic mountain from which creation sprang. The Kaaba, like the Pyramids in Egypt or the Temple in Jerusalem, may have been constructed as an axis mundi, sometimes called a \"navel spot\": a sacred space around which the universe revolves, the link between the earth and the solid dome of heaven. That would explain why there was once a nail driven into the floor of the Kaaba that the ancient Arabs referred to as \"the navel of the world.\" As G. R. Hawting has shown, the ancient pilgrims would sometimes enter the sanctuary, tear off their clothes, and place their own navels over the nail, thereby merging with the cosmos. Alas, as with so many things about the Kaaba, its origins are mere speculation.

At the end of a DNA strand is a microscopic bundle of non-crucial DNA, so that none of the important stuff gets snipped off when the cell divides.

Humans 'not even close' to reaching the maximum ... Living to 150? Humans ‘not even close’ to reaching the maximum lifespan ATHENS, Ga. — Human lifespans are capable of soaring past the current record of 122 years, with people possibly reaching the age of 150, a new study explains. According to a researcher at the University of Georgia, we are “not even close” to reaching the maximum potential lifespan. The findings are based on an analysis of mortality rates going back more than three centuries across 19 countries. Lead author Dr. David McCarthy describes the implications as “profound.” For most of recorded human history, the average life expectancy has been between 20 and 40 years. Today, humans live to be around 80 years-old. Improved nutrition, clean water, better sanitation, and the application of medical science have been key to prolonging life. Experts suspect genetic manipulation, calorie restriction, and new medicines may extend life even further. The team in the study combined reasoning and probability – known as Bayesian theory – to work out potential maximum longevity. Results showed mortality limits have only been postponed in recent years due to records being slow to increase. “As these cohorts attain advanced ages in coming decades, longevity records may therefore increase significantly. Our results confirm prior work suggesting that if there is a maximum limit to the human lifespan, we are not yet approaching it.” (Credit: Anna Shvets from Pexels) So, how long can people really live? Two years ago, another study found life expectancy has the capacity to almost double, going beyond 150. Those findings were based on blood samples from thousands of British and American participants. “Whether or not there is a limit to the human lifespan has been a subject of debate for millennia,” Dr. McCarthy continues. “Historical estimates of the maximum possible lifespan strongly suggest it has increased substantially over recorded history.” The Bible famously records the Hebrews as regarding 80 years as the maximum length of a human life. Around 1,000 years later, the ancient Romans set their official estimate at 100 or 110.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d5", "source_url": "https://guardian.ng/features/why-humans-cannot-live-beyond-150-years-by-study/", "snippet": "Why humans cannot live beyond 150 years, by study | The Guardian ...

They developed an app to predict the maximum lifespan. The study was published in the journal Nature Communications. Experts in biology and biophysics fed an artificial intelligence system vast amounts of Deoxy ribonucleic Acid (DNA)/genetic material and medical data, on hundreds of thousands of volunteers in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US). This allowed them to develop an AI-driven iPhone app that, with simple input from a user, can accurately estimate the rate of biological ageing and maximum lifespan. As part of the big data study, they found there were two key parameters responsible for human lifespan, both covering lifestyle factors and how the body responds. The first factor is biological age, linked to stress, lifestyle and disease, and the second is resilience, reflecting how quickly the first factor returns to normal. This allowed the team to determine that the longest any human is likely to ever live is 150 years; almost double the current UK average lifespan of 81 years.

But after Calment, there was no one else. It was 115 … 115 … 115.” To see if that perceived plateau was real, Dong, Milholland, and Vijg turned to two international databaseson longevity and worked out the oldest individuals who died in any given year. They specifically looked at France, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the U.S.—the four countries with the most supercentenarians, people who live to 110 years or more. The data were clear. Between the 1970s and early 1990s, our maximum age rose from around 110 to 115—and then stopped after 1995, shortly before Jeanne Calment died. In fact, Vijg’s team calculated that in any given year, the odds that at least one person in the world will live past their 125th birthday are less than 1 in 10,000. Despite sanitation, antibiotics, vaccines, and other medical advances, the oldest living people simply aren’t dying any later. They’re unlikely to either, regardless of calorie restriction, drugs like rapamycin, and all of our other efforts to slow the flow of sand through the hourglass. “In science, you never know,” says Vijg. “But I’ve not seen anything that I think would break through the ceiling.” The ceiling is probably hardwired into our biology. As we grow older, we slowly accumulate damage to our DNA and other molecules, which turns the intricate machinery of our cells into a creaky, dysfunctional mess.

Science is once again casting doubt on the idea that we could live to be nearly as old as the biblical Methuselah or Mel Brooks' famous 2,000-year-old man. New research from Singapore-base biotech company Gero looks at how well the human body bounces back from disease, accidents or just about anything else that puts stress on its systems. This basic resilience declines as people age, with an 80-year-old requiring three times as long to recover from stresses as a 40-year-old on average. This should make sense if you've ever known an elderly person who has taken a nasty fall. Recovery from such a spill can be lif- threatening for a particularly frail person, whereas a similar fall might put a person half as old out of commission for just a short time and teenagers might simply dust themselves off and keep going. Extrapolate this decline further, and human body resilience is completely gone at some age between 120 and 150, according to new analysis performed by the researchers. In other words, at some point your body loses all ability to recover from pretty much any potential stressor. The researchers arrived at this conclusion by looking at health data for large groups from the US, the UK and Russia. They looked at blood cell counts as well as step counts recorded by wearables. As people experienced different stressors, fluctuations in blood cell and step counts showed that recovery time grew longer as individuals grew older. The new research contains a certain amount of validation for the idea that humans start dying from the moment we're born, but the process seems to speed up significantly somewhere in the mid-thirties to mid-forties when the body's resilience starts to decline more steeply. The study's conclusion that the body loses all ability to cope -- or at least to recover -- from stress before age 150 is line with the conclusions of similar studies, including one from last year that pegged the maximum possible human age at 138 years.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d8", "source_url": "https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a37144873/human-life-expectancy-limit-150-years/", "snippet": "Humans Could Live to Be 150, Science Says Humans Could Live to Be 150, Science Says The main factor limiting our lifespan is a loss of the ability to bounce back after a setback, called \"physiological resilience. \" Even without major health issues, like cancer, your body will eventually run out of energy to help recover from even minor challenges. Even if you somehow manage to make it through decades of old age without a single major health issue—evading cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and so on—scientists say there's a ceiling on how long you can extend your life, throwing cold water on the ambitious Silicon Valley goal to outsmart death. But the thing that's keeping the human body from reaching immortality is surprisingly mundane: over time, your body loses the \"physiological resilience,\" or the ability to bounce back, that you once had in your younger years. That, scientists say in a study published earlier this year in Nature Communications, is enough to limit our lives to 120 to 150 years at the most. Lead researcher Timothy Pyrkov is part of a Singapore-based biotech company called Gero (yes, the name itself is the prefix meaning \"old age\").

But, the lines are not that clear. Life expectancy and lifespan are two different factors of human well-being that measure longevity. Lifespan refers to the maximum number of years an individual can live, making lifespan unique to everyone. The longest recorded lifespan was Jeanne Calment who lived for 122 years and 5 months, making the maximum possible human lifespan 122 years and 5 months – that is, until someone outlives Calment. Life expectancy, on the other hand, refers to the average age an individual can expect to live at different stages of life. As humans age, physical and cognitive challenges can emerge, making life expectancy a dynamic measurement that changes based on different experiences and lifestyles of an individual. This does not mean that 48 years-old was considered “old” in say, the 1850s. But 48 was the average age that individuals could expect to live to during that time. It turns out that infant mortality rates sharply drive down the average life expectancy in a population (i.e., the number of child deaths in certain regions is so high that there are more childhood deaths than adult deaths, lowering life expectancy for that region). You might think that, since our ability to safely manage childbirth and provide childcare has vastly improved since the 19th century, then children would have a greater chance of surviving into adolescence and even older adulthood. While yes, this is true, and yes, it has certainly contributed to an increase in the human lifespan, humans have been living well into their 70s and 80s since ancient times. For instance, a first century writer, Pliny, dedicated a chapter of The Natural History to individuals who had lived the longest during that time. In the first century, three individuals had already lived to be 100.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d10", "source_url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10946839/Anti-ageing-living-youre-200-really-isnt-pipe-dream.html", "snippet": "Anti-ageing: Why living until you're 200 really isn't a pipe dream ... The idea of living for hundreds of years was once thought to be the pipe dream of billionaires and tech moguls. But scientists at the forefront of anti-ageing research believe they are on the cusp of developing a pill that could lead to people living to the age of 200 and beyond. Medical advances in the last century have led to humans in wealthy nations living into their 80s, almost double the average life expectancy at the turn of the 20th century. Improved nutrition, clean water, better sanitation and huge leaps in medicine have been key in prolonging human life. The oldest known person — the Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who sold canvases to Vincent Van Gogh when she was a girl in the late 1800s — lived to the age of 122, dying in 1997. There is some debate about whether humans can naturally live much beyond that age, but it is hoped that science will take human lifespans beyond what is currently thought possible. Dr Andrew Steele, a British computational biologist and author of a new book on longevity, told MailOnline there is no biological reason humans can't reach the age of 200. He believes the big breakthrough will come in the form of drugs that remove 'zombie cells' in the body, which are thought to be one of the main culprits of tissue and organ decay as we age. Pills that flush these cells out of the body are already in human trials in and could be on the market in as little as 10 years, according to Dr Steele, who believes someone reading this could make it to 150 with the help of the drugs. Another field in particular that piques the interest of anti-ageing scientists is the study of DNA of reptiles and other cold-blooded animals.

A quick and agile attacking midfielder, he was known for his dribbling, playmaking and prolific galscoring abilities. Kopa was an integral member of the Real Madrid side which dominated Europe, winning three consecutive European Cups between 1957-1959. He also helped Les Blues to a third-place finish at the 1958 FIFA World Cup, where he scored three goals. Prior to wining the award in 1958, Kopa was ranked third in 1956 and 1957.

In 2022, France Football modified the rules for the Ballon d'Or. The timing was changed so that awards were given not for achievements during a calendar year, but for a football season, and it was also determined that an international jury of specialized journalists, with one representative per country, from the top 100 in the latest FIFA Men's World Ranking would elect the winner of the award.

If you're curious, last year Thanksgiving was on November 23 and next year, in 2025, it'll be on Thursday, November 27. Why is Thanksgiving celebrated on a Thursday? Drazen Zigic / Getty Images More than 230 years ago, President George Washington designated November 26 as a day of National Thanksgiving in 1789. However, long before then, American colonists had been gathering to celebrate the bounty reaped from their annual harvest with the first recorded Thanksgiving occurring in 1621. According to the Washington Post, it’s possible that colonists began marking the occasion even earlier, with some historians suggesting that settlers put on a Thanksgiving feast as far back as 1565. While November 26 was initially the date the holiday was commemorated on, in 1863, Abraham Lincoln changed it so that Thanksgiving would be observed on the last Thursday in November, rather than a set date like Christmas or the Fourth of July. The proclamation stuck until 1939, when the last Thursday in November happened to coincide with the last day of the month, dramatically shortening the Christmas shopping season and potentially impacting the nation’s economic recovery from the Great Depression.", "timestamp": "2024-11-18"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "source_url": "https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/thanksgiving-day", "snippet": "Thanksgiving Day 2025 in the United States - Time and Date This year: Thu, Nov 27, 2025 ; Next year: Thu, Nov 26, 2026 ; Last year: Thu, Nov 28, 2024. Family Celebration Thanksgiving Day is a day for people in the US to give thanks for what they have. Families and friends get together for a meal, which traditionally includes a roast turkey, stuffing, potatoes, vegetables, cranberry sauce, gravy, and pumpkin pie. In some cities and towns, there are parades during the Thanksgiving weekend. In most areas, these festivities also mark the opening of the Christmas shopping season. Long Weekend in More Than 20 States Many Have the Day Off Most government offices, businesses, schools, universities, colleges, and other organizations are closed on Thanksgiving Day. Many offices and businesses allow staff to have a long four-day weekend for Thanksgiving, so these offices and businesses are also closed on the Day after Thanksgiving Day. Public transit systems usually do not operate on their regular timetables. Thanksgiving Day is one of the busiest periods for travel in the USA. This can cause congestion and overcrowding. Seasonal parades and busy football games can also cause disruption to local traffic. History and Controversy Thanksgiving Day has been an annual holiday in the United States since 1863. However, not everyone sees Thanksgiving Day as a cause for celebration. Some in the US Native American community feel the mythology of the holiday ignores the destruction of indigenous cultures that followed European settlement. Beginning in 1970, a group of Native Americans and their supporters have staged an annual protest for a National Day of Mourning at Plymouth Rock in Plymouth, Massachusetts on Thanksgiving Day. American Indian Heritage Day is also observed at this time of the year. There are claims that the first Thanksgiving Day was held in the city of El Paso, Texas, in 1598. Another early event was held in 1619 in the Virginia Colony. Many people trace the origins of the modern Thanksgiving Day to the harvest celebration the Pilgrims held in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1621. However, their first true thanksgiving was in 1623, when they gave thanks for rain that ended a drought.", "timestamp": "2025-01-18"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "source_url": "https://www.nbcnewyork.com/entertainment/holidays/when-is-thanksgiving-2024-heres-what-to-know-about-the-upcoming-holiday/5995001/", "snippet": "When is Thanksgiving 2024?: Here's when the holiday is this year Nov. 28 is the fourth Thursday in November in 2024, and therefore, when the Thanksgiving holiday will be held this year.

History of Thanksgiving Native Americans in North America celebrated harvest festivals for centuries before a Thanksgiving federal holiday was formally established in the United States. Colonial services for these festivals date back to the late 16th century. The autumnal feasts celebrated the harvest of crops after a season of bountiful growth. In the 1600s, settlers in Massachusetts and Virginia held feasts to express gratitude for survival, fertile fields, and their faith. The Pilgrims in Plymouth, Massachusetts, had their Thanksgiving feast in 1621 with the Wampanoag Native Americans. This 3-day feast is considered the ”first” Thanksgiving celebration in the colonies. However, there were other recorded ceremonies of thanks on these lands. In 1565, Spanish explorers and the local Timucua people of St. Augustine, Florida, celebrated a mass of thanksgiving. In 1619, British settlers proclaimed a day of thanksgiving when they reached a site known as Berkeley Hundred on the banks of Virginia’s James River.", "timestamp": "2025-10-05"}, {"doc_id": "d9", "source_url": "https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/why-is-thanksgiving-so-late-this-year-heres-an-explanation/3608207/", "snippet": "Why is Thanksgiving so late this year?

History of Toyota Toyota's origins lie in the Japanese weaving industry when Sakichi Toyoda invented the world's first automatic loom and, subsequently, set up the Toyoda Spinning and Weaving Company in 1918. His invention reduced defects and increased yields since a loom stopped and would not go on producing imperfect fabric and using up thread after a problem occurred. This principle of designing equipment to stop automatically and call attention to problems immediately (jidoka) remains crucial to the Toyota Production System today. The loom impressed a British Company, the Platt Brothers, so much that, in 1929, they bought the production and sales rights for £100,000. Sakichi gave those proceeds to his son, Kiichiro, to develop automotive technology at Toyoda. This in turn led to the launch of the Company's first ever passenger car in 1936, the Model AA, and in 1937, the Toyota Motor Company was born. Production of Toyota vehicles outside Japan began in 1959 in Brazil and now, besides its own plants, manufacturing subsidiaries and affiliates in Japan, Toyota manufactures Toyota and Lexus brand vehicles and components throughout the world.

Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.(February 2024) The history of Toyota started in 1933 with the company being a division of Toyoda Automatic Loom Works devoted to the production of cars under the direction of the founder's son, Kiichiro Toyoda.[1] Kiichiro Toyoda had traveled to Europe and the United States in 1929 to investigate automobile production and had begun researching gasoline-powered engines in 1930. Toyoda Automatic Loom Works was encouraged to develop automobile production by the Japanese government, which needed domestic vehicle production, due to the war with China.[2] Kiichiro Toyoda seized this opportunity to establish the Automotive Production Division on September 1, 1933, and began preparing to build prototype vehicles. In 1934, the division produced its first Type A Engine, which was used in the first Model A1 passenger car in May 1935 and the G1 truck in August 1935. Production of the Model AA passenger car started in 1936. Early vehicles bear a striking resemblance to the DodgePower Wagon and 1930's Chevrolet, with some parts actually interchanging with their American originals.[2] Although the Toyota Group is best known today for its cars, it is still in the textile business and still makes automatic looms, which are now computerized, and electric sewing machines which are available worldwide. Beginning Toyota Motor Co. was established as an independent and separate company in 1937. Although the founding family's name was written in the Kanji \"豊田\" (rendered as \"Toyoda\"), the company name was changed to a similar word in katakana - トヨタ (rendered as \"Toyota\") because the latter has 8 strokes which is regarded as a lucky number in East Asian culture.[3]", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d4", "source_url": "https://www.philwrighttoyota.com/history-of-toyota.htm", "snippet": "The History of Toyota - Phil Wright Toyota near Little Rock, AR The idea behind Toyota began back in the 1930's when Kiichiro Toyoda, the future founder, and his father started experimenting with car engines in Japan. Service Hours Our Dealership Showroom Hours Contact Us History of Toyota Toyota has built their own reputation by setting new standards in the automotive industry. The Toyota Camry and Corolla are two of their strongest models but additions like the Prius and now other hybrid models, including the RAV4 and Highlander, set Toyota above their competition. Lexus and Scion have both proven to be successful brands as well as the years have passed. With Toyota building off of their strong reputation and innovative lineup, the future is looking very bright for them. The idea behind Toyota began back in the 1930's when Kiichiro Toyoda, the future founder, and his father started experimenting with car engines in Japan. It wasn't until 1934 that they finished their first engine which they called Type A. They tested the Type A engine in different vehicles for about a year and then developed the Model A1 car in 1935. They also developed the Model G1 truck and both vehicles featured the Type A engine. The next few years they spent testing their prototypes and decided to sell them. In 1937 the Toyota Motor Company was established. At first Toyota thrived on producing trucks for the Japanese Army which was especially important during World War II. Toyota continued to grow and they decided to expand their business overseas and in 1957 Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A Inc. was established. Toyota Goes to America The U.S.A Toyota headquarters started selling their vehicles in Hollywood, CA. The Toyopet Crown was the first ever Japanese car sold in the United States and with this, the era began. While sales of the Toyopet Crown weren't as high as Toyota had hoped, the Crown was discontinued in 1961 due to sales and pricing controversies. The Land Cruiser was on sale and still available in the U.S. and this SUV held the Toyota name until 1966 when the Corolla was introduced. The Corolla was the first imported vehicle that was designed specifically for the American market and the American drivers loved it.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d5", "source_url": "https://www.toyota.com/usa/operations/timeline", "snippet": "Timeline - Toyota Discover the milestones that have shaped our history. 1957 Two Toyopet Crown sedans arrive in the United States Toyota Motor Sales founded in California.

(The company’s name was changed to Toyota, which has a more pleasing sound in Japanese.) Toyota subsequently established several related companies, including Toyoda Machine Works, Ltd. (1941), and Toyota Auto Body, Ltd. (1945). During World War II the company suspended production of passenger cars and concentrated on trucks. Faced with wrecked facilities and a chaotic economy in the aftermath of World War II, the company did not resume making passenger cars until 1947 with the introduction of the Model SA. By the 1950s Toyota’s automobile production factories were back in full operation, and to gain competitiveness the company began a careful study of American automobile manufacturers, owing to perceived U.S. technical and economic superiority. Toyota executives toured the production facilities of corporations, including the Ford Motor Company, to observe the latest automobile manufacturing technology and in turn implemented it in their own facilities, yielding a nearly immediate increase in efficiency. In 1957 Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., was established, and the following year the company released the Toyopet sedan, its first model to be marketed in the United States; it was poorly received because of its high price and lack of horsepower. The Land Cruiser, a 4 × 4 utility vehicle released in 1958, was more successful. In 1965 the Toyopet, completely redesigned for American drivers, was re-released as the Toyota Corona, marking the company’s first major success in the United States. During the 1960s and ’70s the company expanded at a rapid rate and began exporting large numbers of automobiles to foreign markets. Toyota acquired such companies as Hino Motors, Ltd.

External circumstances created pressure for the rapid completion of the Koromo Plant, however, and as a result, a new company with capital of 12 million yen was established, plant construction rapidly commenced, and the additional construction costs were borrowed. In accordance with this plan, Toyoda Automatic Loom Works' Automotive Department was spun off and Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. was established as a new company.

The third oldest president at his inauguration was Ronald Reagan, who was 69 when he was sworn in in 1981. \"I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience,\" Reagan famously said in 1984 while running for reelection against Walter Mondale. In fourth place is the nation's ninth president, William Henry Harrison. Harrison was elected in 1841 at age 68, but his tenure as president was short-lived. He died 32 days into his first term, making his presidency the shortest in U.S. history. Who are the oldest living U.S. presidents? The oldest living president is Mr. Biden, who turned 82 on Nov. 20, just weeks after the election. Three former presidents, George W.

Age of U.S. Presidents when taking office 1789-2025 Since 1789, 45 different men have served as President of the United States, and the average age of these men when taking office for the first time was approximately 57 years. Two men, Grover Cleveland and Donald Trump, were elected to two non-consecutive terms, and Donald Trump's victory in 2024 made him the oldest man ever elected as president, where he will be 78 years and seven months old when taking office again. Record holders The oldest president to take office for the first time was Joe Biden in 2021, at 78 years and two months - around five months younger than Donald Trump when he assumes office in 2025. The youngest presidents to take office were Theodore Roosevelt in 1901 (42 years and 322 days), who assumed office following the assassination of William McKinley, and the youngest elected president was John F Kennedy in 1961 (43 years and 236 days). Historically, there seems to be little correlation between age and electability, and the past five presidents have included the two oldest to ever take office, and two of the youngest. Requirements to become president The United States Constitution states that both the President and Vice President must be at least 35 years old when taking office, and must have lived in the United States for at least 14 years of their life. Such restrictions are also in place for members of the U.S. Congress, although the age and residency barriers are lower. Additionally, for the roles of President and Vice President, there is a \"natural-born-citizen\" clause that was traditionally interpreted to mean candidates must have been born in the U.S. (or were citizens when the Constitution was adopted).", "timestamp": "2024-11-06"}, {"doc_id": "d5", "source_url": "https://www.thv11.com/article/news/nation-world/president-biden-turns-82-oldest-us-presidents/507-4a508d88-8c35-49e3-827c-68d3bee2dcb4", "snippet": "Oldest US presidents in office: When would Trump pass Biden?

The biography for President Harrison and past presidents is courtesy of the White House Historical Association. William Henry Harrison, an American military officer and politician, was the ninth President of the United States (1841), the oldest President to be elected at the time. On his 32nd day, he became the first to die in office, serving the shortest tenure in U.S. Presidential history. “Give him a barrel of hard cider and settle a pension of two thousand a year on him, and my word for it,” a Democratic newspaper foolishly gibed, “he will sit … by the side of a ‘sea coal’ fire, and study moral philosophy. ” The Whigs, seizing on this political misstep, in 1840 presented their candidate William Henry Harrison as a simple frontier Indian fighter, living in a log cabin and drinking cider, in sharp contrast to an aristocratic champagne-sipping Van Buren. Harrison was in fact a scion of the Virginia planter aristocracy. He was born at Berkeley in 1773. He studied classics and history at Hampden-Sydney College, then began the study of medicine in Richmond. Suddenly, that same year, 1791, Harrison switched interests. He obtained a commission as ensign in the First Infantry of the Regular Army, and headed to the Northwest, where he spent much of his life. In the campaign against the Indians, Harrison served as aide-de-camp to General “Mad Anthony” Wayne at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, which opened most of the Ohio area to settlement. After resigning from the Army in 1798, he became Secretary of the Northwest Territory, was its first delegate to Congress, and helped obtain legislation dividing the Territory into the Northwest and Indiana Territories. In 1801 he became Governor of the Indiana Territory, serving 12 years. His prime task as governor was to obtain title to Indian lands so settlers could press forward into the wilderness. When the Indians retaliated, Harrison was responsible for defending the settlements.

Donald Trump: Oldest person to be elected US President Donald Trump, after being convicted of a felony and surviving two assassination attempts, secured a second term as US President, defeating Kamala Harris's bid to become the first female president. His victory, fueled by unwavering support despite legal battles, marks him as the oldest person to assume the presidency. Trump's return follows a tumultuous period since his 2020 election loss, including the January 6th Capitol riot and ongoing legal challenges. Donald Trump went from being a businessman, real estate tycoon and a reality TV star to becoming the country's first former US President to be declared a convicted felon. And after surviving two assassination bids during his 2024 campaign, the 78-year old remains unstoppable with American voters giving him a second term. In the process, he shattered the dream of the Democratic Party, as well as that of millions of Kamala Harris supporters, to finally have the first woman President in the White House. He is now the oldest person in US history to be elected president. From the time he left office after his loss in the 2020 presidential election to his nomination as the Republican candidate in the 2024 race, Trump continued to dominate the American news cycle and the country's psyche. He refused to accept the November 2020 result that brought Joe Biden to the White House, and a stunned nation watched his supporters storm the US Capitol on January 6. The riots disrupted a joint session of the US Congress which was in the process of affirming the presidential election results. His third run for the job in 2024 was characterised by a slew of indictments and criminal cases, and a conviction in a New York court -- making him the first former US president to be held guilty of a crime. A grand jury found him guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records.

Rheumatoid factors are immune system proteins that sometimes attack the healthy tissue in your body. A rheumatoid factor test measures the level of rheumatoid factor proteins in your bloodstream. High levels of rheumatoid factors often point to rheumatoid arthritis, as well as Sjogren’s syndrome, and other autoimmune conditions. Results that show a high level can be helpful in confirming a rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis. However, people without autoimmune conditions sometimes have a high level of rheumatoid factor proteins, and not everyone with rheumatoid arthritis has a high level of rheumatoid factor proteins. Cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies are a type of immune system protein called an autoantibody. Autoantibodies are abnormal proteins that attack healthy blood cells and tissues. Between 60 and 80 percent of people with rheumatoid arthritis have CCP antibodies in their blood. An anti-CCP antibody test — also called an ACCP test or CCP-test — looks for the presence of these antibodies to help confirm rheumatoid arthritis. An anti-CCP test can also help doctors determine the severity of a rheumatoid arthritis case. High levels of CCP at diagnosis indicate an increased risk for the fast progression of joint damage. Doctors typically perform both a rheumatoid factor (RF) test and an anti-CCP test when evaluating a person they suspect may have rheumatoid arthritis. A positive result for either test indicates a higher risk for RA, and that risk is increased when both tests are positive.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d2", "source_url": "https://www.arthritis.org/diseases/more-about/testing-for-rheumatoid-arthritis", "snippet": "Testing for Rheumatoid Arthritis | Arthritis Foundation These may include joint pain, tenderness and swelling that affects the same joint or joints on both sides of your body (like both wrists or both knees); fatigue and fever. Lab tests and imaging tests can help your doctor make the diagnosis. Diagnostic Lab Tests Evidence of RA may be seen in the blood, so blood tests play an important role in making a diagnosis. Following are some of the tests your doctor may order. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or sed rate). The ESR can gauge how much inflammation is in your body by measuring how quickly red blood cells (erythrocytes) separate from other cells in the blood and collect as sediment in the bottom of a test tube. Because inflammation can be caused by conditions other than RA, the results must be considered along with those of other tests when making an RA diagnosis. C-Reactive Protein (CRP). This measures levels of CRP, a protein produced by the liver that signals inflammation. High CRP levels are common in RA and other inflammatory forms of arthritis. Because a high CRP may be present with many diseases and conditions, a high CRP in itself does not mean you have arthritis or identify which form you may have. The results must be interpreted in the context of your symptoms as well as the results of other tests. Rheumatoid factor (RF). Rheumatoid factor is a protein made by the immune system which may attack healthy tissues. High levels of rheumatoid factor could help your doctor make a diagnosis of RA. However, RF levels may also be high in other autoimmune diseases, so an RF test alone cannot be used to diagnose RA. Anti-CCP antibody test (ACCP or CCP). This test is for a type of autoantibody called cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies, which can be found in the blood of 60% to 80% of people with rheumatoid arthritis.

Blood tests are usually fast. The doctor sends you to a lab where a worker puts a needle into one of your veins. They take, or \"draw,\" blood into several test tubes. The tests take a few days, and the doctor will call you to go over the results. Common blood tests for rheumatoid arthritis include: What it measures: Rheumatoid factor is a group of proteins your body makes when your immune system attacks healthy tissue. Whatâs normal: 0-20 u/mL (units per milliliter of blood) Whatâs high: 20 u/mL or higher What it means: About 70% to 90% of people with a high reading have RA. But people without RA can still have rheumatoid factor. In general, if you have RA but donât have high RF, your disease will be less severe. RF levels may stay high even if you go into remission. What it measures: Proteins your body makes when there is inflammation. Youâll probably have it done along with the RF test. Whatâs normal: 20 u/mL or less What it means: This test offers a way to catch RA in its early stages. Levels are high in people who have RA or those who are about to get it. A positive test means thereâs a 97% chance you have RA. If you have anti-CCP antibodies, your rheumatoid arthritis might be more severe. Other conditions you might have: None.

However RA is eventually defined, there are two main subtypes in adults: seropositive and seronegative. In seropositive RA, blood tests show unusually high levels of antibodies called anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides (anti-CCPs). These are specific markers for RA and may show up as much as a decade before symptoms do. Around 60% to 80% of people diagnosed with RA have anti-CCPs. By definition, people with seronegative RA don’t have these antibodies in their blood, though that’s in some dispute. Doctors once used an antibody called rheumatoid factor (RF) to test for seropositivity. Most people with anti-CCPs also have RF, but so do people with lots of other conditions, including infections. That’s why anti-CCP is now the preferred test, though an RF test is often used in conjunction with it for greater accuracy. The Role of Blood Tests in RA Diagnosis No single blood test can reliably diagnose RA. Some healthy people test positive for anti-CCPs, while others who have RA have negative test results. Blood tests are just one of several factors, including a medical history, physical exam and X-rays, that help doctors diagnose the disease. Still, antibodies are a pretty good indicator of RA if you have also have joint pain and swelling and damage to bones and cartilage on imaging tests. Seronegative RA is more challenging and takes longer to diagnose because doctors try to rule out other types of arthritis that aren’t associated with high levels of anti-CCP, such as psoriatic arthritis, gout and spondyloarthritis. Still, seronegative RA remains an imprecise diagnosis, according to some experts. It’s rare for someone who is seronegative to become seropositive, but it’s not uncommon for a diagnosis of seronegative RA to be changed to something else later on.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d5", "source_url": "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4924-rheumatoid-arthritis", "snippet": "Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA): Causes, Symptoms & Treatment FAQs ’re more likely to develop RA if you have a close relative who also has it.

Diagnosis and Tests How is rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed? Your healthcare provider may refer you to a physician who specializes in arthritis (rheumatologist). Rheumatologists diagnose people with rheumatoid arthritis based on a combination of several factors. They’ll do a physical exam and ask you about your medical history and symptoms. Your rheumatologist will order blood tests and imaging tests. The blood tests look for inflammation and blood proteins (antibodies) that are signs of rheumatoid arthritis. These may include: About 60% to 70% of people living with rheumatoid arthritis have antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP) (proteins). Your rheumatologist may order imaging tests to look for signs that your joints are wearing away. Rheumatoid arthritis can cause the ends of the bones within your joints to wear down. The imaging tests may include: In some cases, your provider may watch how you do over time before making a definitive diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. What are the diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis?

As with many blood tests, labs each have their own, slightly different reading of what ESR numbers mean, which they interpret based on past results, explains Cadet. Age is also a factor. “ESR can be elevated slightly in elderly patients and still be normal for that person,” she says.

Frequency of TestingCRP analysis may be done for diagnosis and then several times a year to assess whether inflammation has responded to treatment, notes Cadet. 5. Psoriatic Arthritis Blood Test: Rheumatoid Factor Rheumatoid factor (RF), a protein produced by the immune system that can be a marker for autoimmune dysfunction, is sometimes an indication of systemic inflammation.

Key Facts You Need to Know PUBLISHED 11/15/18 BY Marissa Laliberte When diagnosing and treating RA, blood tests aren’t everything. There are two main types of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults: seropositive and seronegative. Both have the same symptoms — joint pain, morning stiffness, fatigue, fever, low appetite — but the primary difference is in the bloodwork. In most people diagnosed with RA, blood tests reveal abnormally high levels of antibodies called rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP), which signal that the immune system is in overdrive and may be attacking healthy tissues instead of just foreign invaders like germs. The majority of rheumatoid arthritis patients are seropositive: 50 percent to 70 percent of RA patients have anti-CCP antibodies and 65 percent to 80 percent have rheumatoid factor antibodies, research shows. However, this means that a sizeable number of people with RA are considered to be seronegative, which means they don’t have either of these antibodies in their blood. Keep in mind that blood tests are just one part of the process that doctors use to diagnose RA. Learn more about different tests that diagnose RA here. How Are Blood Tests Used to Help Diagnose RA? RF and anti-CCP tests don’t definitively point to RA because some healthy people without RA test positive for these antibodies, while other people who do have autoimmune problems test negative, says Umbreen Hasan, MD, consultant rheumatologist for Allina Health in Minnesota. That’s why doctors will also consider RA symptoms, inflammation levels, and the amount of joint swelling with the help of X-rays and ultrasounds.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d8", "source_url": "https://www.versusarthritis.org/about-arthritis/conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/", "snippet": "Rheumatoid arthritis | Causes, symptoms, treatments If they think you have rheumatoid arthritis, they will refer you to a rheumatologist and may arrange blood tests to help confirm a diagnosis. Blood tests There's no single blood test that can confirm you have rheumatoid arthritis. However, there are a few tests that can show possible signs of the condition. Some of the main tests are outlined below. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) A sample of your red blood cells are put into a test tube of liquid. The cells are timed to see how long they take to get to the bottom of the tube. If the cells sink faster than usual, you may have levels of inflammation that are higher than normal. Rheumatoid arthritis is just one possible cause. C-reactive protein (CRP) This test can show if there is inflammation in your body. It does this by checking how much CRP there is in your blood. If there is more CRP than usual, you may have inflammation in your body. Full blood count A full blood count measures the number of red blood cells you have. These carry iron around your body, and a low number of red blood cells means you have a low iron content. This may mean you have anaemia (an-ee-me-er) and is common in people with RA, although having anaemia doesn't prove you have RA. Rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies About half of all people with rheumatoid arthritis have rheumatoid factor in their blood when the condition starts. However, around 1 in every 20 people without rheumatoid arthritis also test positive for rheumatoid factor. There is another antibody test called anti-CCP that you can take.

Frequently Asked Questions 1. Can rheumatoid arthritis be diagnosed with a blood test alone? No, rheumatoid arthritis cannot be diagnosed with a blood test alone. While certain blood markers can indicate the presence of the disease, a comprehensive evaluation that includes clinical examination, medical history, and imaging tests is necessary for an accurate diagnosis. 2. What other tests may be done to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis? In addition to blood tests, imaging tests such as X-rays, ultrasounds, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be done to assess joint damage and inflammation. These tests can provide valuable information to support the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. 3. Can rheumatoid arthritis be cured? Currently, there is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis. However, with early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, the symptoms can be managed effectively, and joint damage can be minimized. 4. What are the treatment options for rheumatoid arthritis? The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis typically involves a combination of medication, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are commonly prescribed to slow down the progression of the disease and reduce inflammation. 5. How can I manage the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis? In addition to medical treatment, there are several self-care strategies that can help manage the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. These include regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, applying heat or cold to affected joints, and using assistive devices to reduce joint stress. 6. Can rheumatoid arthritis affect other parts of the body? Yes, rheumatoid arthritis can affect other parts of the body besides the joints. It can cause inflammation in the eyes, lungs, heart, and blood vessels, leading to complications in these organs. 7. Is rheumatoid arthritis hereditary?", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d10", "source_url": "https://www.ccjm.org/content/86/3/198", "snippet": "Laboratory tests in rheumatology: A rational approach | Cleveland ... Hence, a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis cannot be confirmed with a positive result alone, nor can it be excluded with a negative result. Anticitrullinated peptide antibody, on the other hand, is much more specific for rheumatoid arthritis (95%), as it is seldom seen in other conditions, but its sensitivity is similar to that of rheumatoid factor (68%).4–6 A positive result would thus lend strength to the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, but a negative result would not exclude it. Approach to early arthritis When faced with a patient with early arthritis, some key questions to ask include7,8: Is this an inflammatory or a mechanical problem? Inflammatory arthritis is suggested by joint swelling that is not due to trauma or bony hypertrophy, early morning stiffness lasting longer than 30 minutes, and elevated inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein). Involvement of the small joints of the hands and feet may be suggested by pain on compression of the metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints, respectively. Is there a definite identifiable underlying cause for the inflammatory arthritis? The pattern of development of joint symptoms or the presence of extraarticular symptoms may suggest an underlying problem such as gout, psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or sarcoidosis. If the arthritis is undifferentiated (ie, there is no definite identifiable cause), is it likely to remit or persist? This is perhaps the most important question to ask in order to prognosticate.", "timestamp": ""}], "per_doc_notes": [{"doc_id": "d1", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "Blood tests such as rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibody tests can help confirm a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.", "quote": "Results that show a high level can be helpful in confirming a rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis. ...

Reduced Risk of Type 2 Diabetes and Other Metabolic Problems The detrimental health impacts of sitting—and the benefits of standing—appear to go beyond simple obesity. Some of the same studies by Levine and others have found that sitting for extended periods of time is correlated with reduced effectiveness in regulating levels of glucose in the bloodstream, part of a condition known as metabolic syndrome that dramatically increases the chance of type 2 diabetes. A 2008 study, for instance, found that people who sat for longer periods during their day had significantly higher levels of fasting blood glucose, indicating their their cells became less responsive to insulin, with the hormone failing to trigger the absorption of glucose from the blood. A 2013 study [PDF] came to similar findings, and arrived at the conclusion that for people already at risk of developing type 2 diabetes, the amount of time spent sitting could be a more important risk factor than the amount of time spent vigorously exercising. Reduced Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Scientific evidence that sitting is bad for the cardiovascular system goes all the way back to the 1950s, when British researchers compared rates of heart disease in London bus drivers (who sit) and bus conductors (who stand) and found that the former group experienced far more heart attacks and other problems than the latter.

There is no doubt that spending more time on your feet is beneficial for heart health. Bottom Line: It is widely accepted that the more time you spend sitting, the greater your risk of developing heart disease. 4. Standing Desks Appear to Reduce Back Pain Back pain is one of the most common complaints of office workers who sit all day. To determine if standing desks could improve this, several studies have been done on employees with long-term back pain. Participants have reported up to a 32% improvement in lower back pain after several weeks of using standing desks (11, 12). Another study published by the CDC found that use of a sit-stand desk reduced upper back and neck pain by 54% after just 4 weeks (13). Additionally, removal of the sit-stand desks reversed some of those improvements within a 2-week period. Bottom Line: Several studies show that standing desks can dramatically decrease chronic back pain caused by prolonged sitting. 5. Standing Desks Help Improve Mood and Energy Levels Standing desks appear to have a positive influence on overall well-being. In one 7-week study, participants using standing desks reported less stress and fatigue than those who remained seated the entire work day (13). Additionally, 87% of those using standing desks reported increased vigor and energy throughout the day. Upon returning to their old desks, overall moods reverted to their original levels. These findings align with broader research on sitting and mental health, which links sedentary time with an increased risk of both depression and anxiety (14, 15). Bottom Line: One study found that standing desks can lower feelings of stress and fatigue, while improving mood and energy levels. 6.

Standing for a long time with your knees locked or wearing heels can cause stress to your legs and even your lower back. Keep your knees loose and slightly bent. Look for a comfortable standing mat that’s made to accompany the desk and wear comfortable, supportive shoes while you stand. Choose an adjustable standing desk. Many options sit right on top of your standard desk and use hydraulics to raise and lower the platform that holds your computer easily. These ergonomic standing desks make it simple to reap all the benefits of standing at work. 7 Benefits of Standing at Work Whether you’re working from your home office or working from a busy shared space, a standing desk is a great option to improve your health during the workday. Here are 7 benefits of standing at work. 1. Burns Calories Standing burns more calories than sitting, even if you simply stand still. Now, the calorie difference between standing versus sitting isn’t huge. Standing burns about 100-200 calories per hour, while sitting burns 60-130 calories. But over time, it can add up. The other calorie-burning benefit of standing at work is the shift in your mindset. When you’re standing up, you’re more likely to keep your mind in “wellness mode.” You’ll walk around a bit more often throughout the day. You might do some leg lifts or take a quick break with some squats or jumping jacks. These little shifts in activity help you burn more calories during your workday. 2. Gives You an Energy Burst In an analysis of 53 studies published in the Applied Ergonomics journal, having a standing desk encouraged workers to spend more time on their feet. Researchers in the UK found that 66% of workers felt more productive and 87% felt more energized by spending just an hour of their workday standing. The findings were so useful that they began the Smart Work and Life program to encourage office workers to get more active. Small movements and active moments throughout the day help you stay awake and alert.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d4", "source_url": "https://health.clevelandclinic.org/will-standing-work-improve-health/", "snippet": "Are Standing Desks Better for You? – Cleveland Clinic Looking for health + wellness advice? Are Standing Desks Better for You? If you have an office job where you sit hunched over a desk, clicking away at a computer most of the day, you need to take steps – literally – to reduce your sedentary habits. Our bodies are built to move, so sitting for hours at a time is bad news for your health (hello dead butt syndrome!). Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy “Some research suggests that people who sit excessively have increased risk for obesity, diabetes and heart disease,” says occupational therapist Michael Milicia. “Even if you’re actively working, usually your lower body is relatively static, and there is decreased circulation. Also, less movement throughout your day means more aches and pains.” Studies show that standing and moving more throughout the day will positively impact your health. Exercise and activity level (or movement in general) is one of the most dramatically modifiable risk factors that individuals can change. How to get more movement into your day While you probably can’t completely get away from sitting at your desk (or at least sitting for some parts of your workday), there are things you can do to be an “active sitter.” Take breaks often. Take micro breaks to stand, stretch and walk around to get your blood pumping and circulating. Set your computer alarm to remind yourself to stop working and stretch. Or do some standing yoga poses. If your work space allows, get your blood flowing with squats, lunges, wall push-ups or planks. Try a standing desk. If you can, invest in a standing desk or find tasks where you can stand, such as talking on the telephone or reading hard copy reports. Put your file cabinet on the other side of the room so that you have to walk over to it. If you do have a standing desk, alternate between sitting and standing every hour.

But did you know theyâre lowering their risk for heart disease, obesity, and back and neck pain, too? Studies have linked sitting a lot to these and other health problems. Even people who exercise most days face health risks if they sit too much. Standing desks raise your computer high enough for you to work and stand at the same time. This keeps you on your feet for more of the day. Types of Standing Desks All standing desks follow the same basic idea -- they let you work while you stand. Fixed-height desks stay at your standing height. Sit-stand desks go up and down so you can sit or stand whenever you feel like it. Power sit-stand desks go up with the push of a button. You can lift manual ones with a handle or raise them with a lever or crank. You can buy a standing desk online or at an office supply, electronics, or big-box store. A basic fixed-height desk will cost you less than $100, but a really nice electric desk can cost more than $1,000. Treadmill desks take the idea a step further by letting you walk while you work, but they can cost more than $1,000, too. The Pros Besides less sitting time, standing at work has other benefits: More calories burned: One study showed that standing sheds 88 calories an hour, compared to 80 calories for sitting. Walking burns a lot more -- 210 calories an hour. Less back pain: Sitting for long periods of time tightens your muscles and can hurt your lower back, especially if you have bad posture. Standing desks seem to help ease back pain, but doctors don't know how much time you need to stand to get this benefit.

Why are standing desks so good for pain? It’s not the standing part that is beneficial, but rather the movement, explains April Chambers, associate professor of health and human development at University of Pittsburgh. Unlike a traditional desk, a standing station nudges us off our chairs, changing our posture. Then once we’re up, we naturally shift around. Think about Zoom calls: You can usually tell when someone’s at a standing desk because they’re moving around, Dennerlein points out. These micro and macro movements do more for the muscles and joints than you’d think. By changing your posture, the load on your joints changes and you get the blood flowing to other parts of the body, he notes. “That’s why going between sitting and standing is really helpful for you.” So they really live up to the hype? Well, if you buy one hoping it’ll help you drop pounds, you might be disappointed. When standing desks first came out, some people thought of them as a weight loss tool, but that promise hasn’t held up in research, Chambers says. Turns out, doing a desk job on your feet isn’t much of a fat burner. As Dennerlein puts it, “The calories burned if you stand all day are equivalent to a slice of bread.” What’s the best way to position yourself at an adjustable-height desk? There’s no one-size-fits-all, says Dennerlein. “What’s important when using a standing desk is paying attention to your body. What feels good? What doesn’t feel good?” While the classic 90-90-90 ergonomics rule for sitting at a desk—where your knees, pelvis and elbows are all at 90-degree angles—is a good starting point, there’s actually a lot of deviation in how people like to work while standing, and that’s just fine.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d7", "source_url": "https://www.autonomous.ai/ourblog/9-true-health-benefits-of-a-standing-desk", "snippet": "9 True Health Benefits of a Standing Desk Along with the standing desk advantages and enjoying standing desk health benefits, it is also equally important to realize that standing desks are only helpful when applied, used and researched properly.

Below is an extensive guide on how to make the most of standing while working and the types of posture to avoid or practice while using a standing desk. What Is a Standing Desk? Standing desks, which are also referred to as height-adjustable desks, sit-stand desks, or stand-up desks, is essentially a desk that lets you draw, write, and work while standing up or using a high stool. There are several different types, which allows you to get the one that fits your office and budget the best. The mental health benefit of the standing desk and the physical ones are just some of the advantages that this desk provides over your regular office desks. How Standing Desks Help Your Mental and Physical Health Are standing desks good for your health? Working for long hours while sitting puts people’s health at risk due to the sedentary life it enforces. As an office worker, you may not have a choice in the matter while you’re at work, but you may even spend your evening at home sitting as well. When you begin fixing that sedentary habit by investing in a standing desk, you considerably reduce some of the risks associated with it, such as obesity, weight gain, heart disease, and diabetes. The mental health benefit of a standing desk is also plentiful, as it considerably improves your work satisfaction. If that still doesn’t convince you that a standing desk is worth it, you only need to look a little bit further to be wholly convinced.

But is it really better to stand all day, rather than sit? Can standing make you healthier, or help you lose weight? Dr. Aaron Carroll isn't so sure. Dr. Aaron Carroll says there's not much evidence to suggest that standing desks have a real impact on health. (Submitted by Aaron Carroll) \"There's just not much evidence that that's the case,\" said Carroll, who is the director of the Center for Health Policy and Professionalism Research at the Indiana University School of Medicine. \"In fact, there's very little evidence at all that switching people from sitting to standing desks makes much of a difference on anyone's health,\" he said. With the proliferation of reports about the hazards of sitting, Carroll can understand why people think standing is better, but says that the connection between poor health and sitting isn't always so simple. \"We're trying to argue somehow that it's the sitting that makes people unhealthy, instead of saying that perhaps people who are otherwise unhealthy or poor or unemployed or who have other issues are sitting a lot, and that's what's making them unhealthy, not necessarily the sitting,\" he said. Standing is not exercise Standing is not exercise, and jobs that require people to spend most of their day standing often tend to be unhealthier, Carroll said. \"Just standing doesn't get you the same kinds of benefits or health effects that exercising would,\" he said. \"Secondly, there's not a lot of great evidence to show that exercise is the way to lose weight. Most of the way that people lose weight has much more to do with what they're eating and nutrition than it does with exercise. \" While standing does not bring the health benefits people think, Carroll says it is important to get up and move during the day. \"People need to get up every once in a while, walk around and be active,\" he said. \"There's probably a bunch of reasons that might be a good idea, the least of which is weight loss. It might actually clear your head, it might provide you with a better work environment, it might improve your mood.

Benefits, Explained In other words, we can’t convincingly say that standing desks are better for you. Here’s what we do know. A 2011 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed that standing desks reduced upper back and neck pain and improved overall mood vs sitting down. While this sounds compelling, there are two obvious flaws to this conclusion: 1) there’s likely a placebo effect at least partially involved with the latter, and 2) the study didn’t look into possible drawbacks of standing desk. Orthopedic Health Effects On the topic of orthopedic health, standing is certainly a better option for your posture, as well as back and neck, than sitting. However, standing for long periods of time also brings it’s own share of issues, primarily related to knee pain. When factoring in all the unique drawbacks of standing desk, research around this issue suggests that standing desks generally don’t offer more orthopedic benefits to sitting desks. There are ways to counteract some of the drawbacks of standing desks. For example, fatigue mats have been shown in some studies to reduce standing fatigue and knee strain by as much as 60%. While there certainly isn’t any research to drive this conclusion, that difference might just be enough to tip a standing desk setup over the edge in comparing it to it’s 4-legged counterpart. Impact On Obesity The other purported benefit of standing desks is supposed to be for obesity. On that front, there is a scientific consensus. A standing desk setup doesn’t burn significantly more calories than sitting down, and it certainly isn’t anywhere close to the miracle obesity cure it has often been hyped to be. At best you can expect to burn a few pounds a year, but week to week it won’t make much of a difference.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d10", "source_url": "https://walkolution.com/blogs/the-walkolution-blog/standing-deks-overrated", "snippet": "Standing Desks Don´t Provide Health Benefits | Walkolution ...

Sitting is bad - but standing is not any better At least five large, prospective studies have found that increased total sitting time, that is, combined work and leisure sitting time, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. These studies controlled for important confounders, such as age, education, smoking, employment, leisure time physical activity, body mass index (BMI), diet, hypertension, and cholesterol. The risk increased approximately 50% among those who sat more than 10 to 12 hours per day compared with those who sat less. These and numerous other studies raised public awareness, that sitting at work (and the high amount of sitting outside of work) leads to various public health risks and alternatives needs to be offered.

Birds meet and then carry on a courtship that includes dinner dates, dancing and just hanging out together. Birds, especially males, sing, show off a lot and wear flashy adornments just to impress females. Then if the two birds like each other, they become a pair, build a nest, raise youngsters, school them and send them off to form their own families. Also like people, pairs are not always faithful and will have flings with individuals other than their own mates. If the marriage doesn’t result in raising young, the pair may “divorce”, remarry and try again. Discover the monogamous birds that mate for life. Birds That Mate for Life It’s fairly rare to find monogamous birds that remain together “until death do us part,” a fact not realized until pretty recently. Until the development of DNA fingerprinting techniques in the 1980s, most people thought birds faithfully mated for life, or at least for the season. Using DNA, scientists have produced some shocking discoveries. Most birds are far from monogamous. Most birds do not mate for life, and most of those that do aren’t quite as faithful as we’d like to think. Over 92 percent of all bird species form a pair bond and stay together for at least part of the nesting cycle. Yet DNA tests of baby birds have shown that in over 75 percent of these species, some birds have mated with one or more birds other than their “social mate.” Monogamous Birds Yet, there are a few species of birds that meet, court and form pair bonds that result in many offspring, year after year, until one of the pair dies.

Black Vulture Average clutch size: 2 eggs Cool fact: This vulture species doesn’t build a nest, but rather lays its eggs on the ground or in hollow cavities. Yes, even Black Vultures stick together. “One bird, presumed to be male, chases a presumed female through the air and periodically dives at her” as part of the mating ritual, according to Birds of North America online. They form such a tight bond, in fact, that they hang out year round—not just during breeding season.

These birds, the symbol of the United States, mate for life unless one of the two dies. Their spectacular courtship rituals are a sight to see, with the birds locking talons, then flipping, spinning, and twirling through the air in a maneuver called a Cartwheel Display.

Laysan Albatrosses, which don’t breed until they’re eight or nine years old, are monogamous, annually solidifying their bond through ritual dancing. “If they do lose their mate, they will go through a year or two of a mourning period,” says John Klavitter, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist at Midway Atoll.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d3", "source_url": "https://www.bbcearth.com/news/seven-animals-who-mate-for-life", "snippet": "Seven animals who mate for life | BBC Earth Seven animals who mate for life Finding that special someone in your life is a beautiful thing, but when it comes to animals it's also quite rare. Although an estimated 90% of bird species partner up for life, the same can’t be said for mammals. According to Hemanth P. Niar and Larry J Young’s study, Genes to Brain to Behavior, it is estimated that only 3% to 5% of all mammal species (excluding humans) form monogamous relationships. And even then, it’s complicated. But despite their rarity, life-long partnerships throughout the animal kingdom can be found, from canine power couples to worms who take the idea of becoming one to a whole new level. Here are seven animals that are in it for the long haul. More on Nature Wolves – Power couples In a grey wolf pack, it is usually only the male and female alpha who are allowed to breed, The pair mate for life as a way to cement their position as pack leaders, producing a new litter each year and ensuring the stability of the rest of the pack. As explained by David W. Macdonald et al in Monogamy: Cause, Consequence, or Corollary of Success in Wild Canids, monogamy makes it easier for alphas to display their strength and superiority over the other male members of the pack. Defending one mate against advances is much easier than trying to protect numerous partners, assuring their place as top dog. Beavers – Sharing is caring For Eurasian beavers, monogamy is more about practicality than romance. Unlike their North American counterparts who have been known to mate outside their bonded partners, Eurasian beavers team up for life as a way to increase their chances of survival. Although one of their primary sources of food is tree bark, its lack of nutritional value means that beavers need to eat a lot of bark to keep themselves going. So, by pairing up, couples can split their workload and ensure everything gets done.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d4", "source_url": "https://safarisafricana.com/birds-that-mate-for-life/", "snippet": "Birds That Mate For Life: 15 Monogamous Bird Species✔️ Birds That Mate For Life 15 of the world’s most amorous birds The world of wildlife behaviors is incredibly varied, with all manner of sexual practice on display. For birds specifically, the World Wildlife Foundation found that around 90% of species choose monogamy as their reproductive strategy. This is a huge number compared to mammals at just 5%. The thinking behind why birds are generally monogamous is that the parental time investment needed to raise chicks is so large. One parent is needed to incubate eggs in a nest, while the other collects food for the pair, and the chicks once they’re hatched. By the time the chicks leave the nest it’s almost breeding season again, leaving little time to find a new mate. As most species of birds are monogamous, we’ve picked a selection of 15 of the most romantic birds that mate for life. So pour yourself a glass of wine, dim the lights and turn on the romantic music, we’re about to meet nature’s most loving birds: Black vultures Black vultures Vultures are not generally thought of as amorous birds – in fact, they have rather a grim reputation. Black vultures can teach humans a lesson or two in love, however, as bonded pairs mate for life and stay together as much as possible all year-round. During their courtship, male vultures circle the female they’re wooing with an extended neck, then dive down towards them. Macaroni Penguins Macaroni penguins As with birds generally, most penguin species mate for life. Marconi penguins (also known as Royal Penguins) take loving relationships to a new level, however, performing an ‘ecstatic display’ when they see each other after being apart, puffing up their chests, swinging their heads around, and making a gurgling sound. Once their chick is hatched, the father stays with the offspring while the mother heads off to hunt for food for the family.

Not really But, to be fair, a bird's definition of monogamy is also surprisingly liberal. Yet, there are a few species of birds that meet, court and form pair-bonds that result in many offspring, year after year, until one of the pair dies. These large birds are considered as mating for life. Among them are: mute swans, Canada geese, bald eagles and great horned owls. Why birds mate for life is not as romantic as one may think. When you consider the possible time needed to migrate, to establish territories, sit on eggs and raise the young, you'll realize that the extra time and energy needed to attract a mate would minimize reproductive time. The bald eagle, for example, spends just over a month incubating the eggs and almost three months raising their young in the nest. Establishing lifelong bonds works to their advantage. The question of whether a bird mates for life comes from pondering what happens should one bird die. Many believe that birds mourn the loss of their mate, never to mate again. There is a lot of conjecture whether birds experience loss at some level or if we sometimes interpret confusion as mourning. I do know our wild birds will always attempt to find new mates. Scientists have amassed enough data to debunk the romantic notion that most birds pair up faithfully for life. Lots of monogamous bird species “cheat” and some “divorce” but at rates much lower than humans. Male birds with a high proportion of daily female exposure are less likely to “divorce” their partner between breeding seasons. Interestingly, the absolute number of female interactions isn't important — just the ratio of females to males in the social group. This behavior was discovered by Dr. Antica Culina of Oxford University’s Zoology Department when they studied British chickadees. But monogamy isn’t the same as mating for life. A pair-bond may last for just one nesting (two nests per season on average), such as with house wrens, or one breeding season, common with most songbird species, like chickadees and goldfinches.

One of the most interesting behaviors exhibited by some bird species is their lifelong commitment to their mates. These birds pair up for life and remain loyal to each other, sharing the responsibilities of parenting and nest-building. In this article, we will take a look at ten bird species that mate for life, exploring their unique mating behaviors. 1. Bald Eagles Iconic birds in the United States, Balde Eagles are known for their majestic appearance and impressive wingspan. They mate for life and build large nests, called aeries, high up in trees or on cliffs, which they may use for many years. Bald eagles were once endangered in the United States, but conservation efforts have helped their populations to rebound in recent years. 2. Swans Like bald eagles, swans are also known for their monogamous mating habits. They form strong bonds with their partners and are known to stay together for life. Swans are also known for their impressive displays of affection, such as “billing” where they touch their bills together and make soft honking sounds. Overall, swans are a symbol of love and loyalty and are often used in art and literature to represent these qualities. 3. Penguins Penguins are a group of flightless birds that are known for their unique tuxedo-like appearance and their ability to survive in some of the harshest environments on Earth. They are also famous for their monogamous mating behavior, with many species forming long-lasting pair bonds. Penguins typically mate with the same partner each breeding season and will often return to the same nesting site year after year. Some penguin species even engage in elaborate courtship rituals, such as the “ecstatic display” of the emperor penguin, which involves singing and bowing. 4. Lovebirds Lovebirds are small parrots known for their affectionate behavior and popularity as pets. In their natural habitats, these birds often mate for life and form strong bonds with their partners.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d7", "source_url": "https://chipperbirds.com/what-backyard-birds-mate-for-life/", "snippet": "What Backyard Birds Mate For Life Both parents take turns incubating the eggs and taking care of the hatchlings They work together to find food and protect their young from predators Males may take on more aggressive roles in protecting the nest while females may do more nurturing tasks Their equal partnership allows for better chances of survival for their offspring as they both contribute equally to their development This behavior is not limited to just one species but spans across multiple types of birds that mate for life. Aside from this unique partnership, birds that mate for life also have specialized calls and rituals that they use to reaffirm their bond. These behaviors add to the uniqueness of their relationship. Birds that mate for life have been documented throughout history, with some pairs living up to 20 years together. Their devotion inspired many stories and legends in different cultures around the world, highlighting the importance and beauty of commitment and mutualism in relationships. Who needs a wingman when you have a mate for life? Birds know the importance of strong social bonds better than most humans. Stronger Social Bonds Birds that mate for life exhibit a stronger attachment to their partners, leading to better social bonds. This bond is a result of the time and effort put into selecting a mate, building nests together, and raising offspring. The emotional connection among these birds often leads them to establish social hierarchies and resolve conflicts without aggression. As the bond deepens, each bird takes on specific roles in the relationship, such as one partner incubating eggs while the other brings food. This division of labor helps establish trust and communication between both individuals. Over time, these pairs get so comfortable with each other that they can communicate through unique calls that are not used with other birds. Moreover, some bird species have been known to mourn when their partner dies, which highlights the depth of their emotional connection. For example, Dusky Seaside Sparrows suffered over 8 years after losing their habitat along with their mates and eventually became extinct due to their inability to find new partners. You may not believe in love at first sight, but these birds are proving that loving for life is the key to a high survival rate for their offspring.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d8", "source_url": "https://www.ecologycenter.us/genetic-diversity/monogamy-polygamy-and-promiscuity.html", "snippet": "Monogamy polygamy and promiscuity - Genetic Diversity - Ecology ... Humans have the ability to engage in various relationship structures, including monogamous relationships, polyamorous relationships, and many others. Some individuals naturally lean towards monogamy, while others may be more inclined towards polyamory. Ultimately, human relationships and preferences can vary greatly, so it is important to recognize and respect different relationship choices and dynamics. Several mammal species are known to form long-term monogamous pair bonds and mate for life. Some examples include: Wolves: Gray wolves form monogamous pairs and typically mate for life. They often stay together as a breeding pair, raising their offspring together in a pack. Gibbons: Gibbons are small apes found mainly in Southeast Asia. They are known for their monogamous mating system and long-term pair bonds, where a male and female stay together for their entire lives. Swans: Many species of swans, such as the mute swan, are known for their monogamous behavior. Once paired, they typically stay together for life, participating in activities like mating, nesting, and raising their cygnets together. Albatrosses: These large seabirds form lifelong pair bonds and mate for life. They spend most of their lives at sea but return to their breeding colonies to mate and raise their chicks together. French angelfish: Found in the waters of the Caribbean Sea, these brightly colored fish form pairs that stay together for life. They engage in cooperative behaviors, including defending territories and taking care of their eggs. It's important to note that while these species are known for their monogamous behavior, there can be exceptions or instances of infidelity in certain cases. There is no definitive answer to whether humans are \"meant\" to be monogamous or not, as behavioral patterns can vary among individuals and cultures. Monogamy, the practice of having a single committed partner at a time, is observed in many human societies, while other societies practice polygamy or polyamory. Some argue that monogamy provides stability,", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d9", "source_url": "https://sentientmedia.org/animals-that-mate-for-life/", "snippet": "15 Animals That Mate for Life 15 Animals That Mate for Life Read Next The human fascination with finding our one true love to spend the rest of our lives with has caused us to be especially interested in non-human animals that also behave this way. But even among creatures that mate for life, there is a huge variety of relationship types that mirror the gamut of the human experience — from monogamy to open relationships to dating around. Regardless of the type of relationship these animals display, the relationships enable the animals to perpetuate their species, a goal that we as humans can either help with or make more complicated. 1. Lovebirds When we think of nonhuman animals in love, the first pairing that likely comes to mind is lovebirds. After all, the word “love” is in their name. Love birds in a pair often feed their partner. There are nine species of love birds, and monogamy is an essential part of social stability within their flocks. If one of the birds in a pairing goes missing or dies, the other bird will act erratically. Love birds that live alone as pets exhibit similar behaviors to these pining wild birds. 2. Oldfield Mice Oldfield mice mate for life, making them unique among rodents. They are also more nurturing than other rodent species. In fact, both the father and the mother mouse will work together to build an elaborate nest and care for their young. Even the mice’s closest known relative, deer mice, are much more promiscuous, having multiple partners over their lifetime. 3. Atlantic Puffins Atlantic puffins, native to areas in the North Atlantic such as Eastern Canada, New England and Western Europe, are small and distinctive black and white birds. Puffins can dive up to 200 feet underwater in search of fish, sometimes carrying more than one fish at a time back to the surface. Puffins are monogamous. They mate with the same partner each year starting at around five years old. Although solitary at sea, puffins reunite at breeding grounds, reconnecting through mating rituals with their partner. In fact, male and female puffins take turns incubating their egg until the baby puffin hatches and makes its way to the ocean.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d10", "source_url": "https://beautyofbirds.com/do-birds-die-when-their-mate-dies/", "snippet": "Do Birds Die When Their Mate Dies? Do Birds Die When Their Mate Dies? There are many online videos that proclaim that baya weavers are inseparable, even in death. But do birds die when their mate dies? I explore this myth in the article below and share the truth – and perhaps there’s a lesson in it for humans as well. You might have frequently heard that many bird species are monogamous – and taken it to mean that they mate for life. However, monogamy in the animal kingdom is slightly different. “Monogamous” birds are simply species that bond with a single mate for the duration of a single breeding season. They may or may not match up again in the next season. The primary reason for this is to ensure the best scenario for the offspring’s survival by having both parents present during its growth. What Bird Kills Itself When Its Mate Dies? No bird species kills itself when its mate – either seasonal or lifelong – passes away. Animal suicide cases, while not totally unknown, are rare and usually motivated by – Depression, Stress, Group defense behavior (for example – killing themselves to save the colony), or Parasitism (when a parasite takes control of the host’s behavior and drives it towards death). Over the years, various media outlets have reported individual cases of ducks or dogs killing or starving themselves after their mate or owner dies. You must understand that these are exceptions and not the rule. Do Birds Mourn Their Dead? Birds do exhibit behavior that can be akin to grief or mourning after losing a chick, a flockmate, or a mate. However, whether this can be classified as grief is a topic of debate. In humans, grief is an emotion that lasts long and often alters the host’s behavior. Humans display long-term memory of the event too. While birds do “mourn” and exhibit certain rituals when they die, they do not exhibit long-term behavioral alterations. These rituals can be elaborate, such as when magpies “decorate” the dead body using clips of grass or when crows circle over the area.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d11", "source_url": "https://oceanconservancy.org/blog/2020/02/13/albatross-really-mate-life/", "snippet": "Does the Albatross Really Mate for Life? - Ocean Conservancy Attention: Your browser is no longer supported and will not receive any further security updates.

You might not know it, but as corporations have tried to sell us all on tomorrow being THE day for love (and for us to hand over our money), what they’ve actually been selling us is the lifestyle of an albatross—or at least, the idealized life of an albatross. i If you’ve ever seen Blue Planet you’re probably familiar with albatross’ admirable “monogamy.” When searching for a mate, albatross do a little dance, make a little love, get down for life. Every year, after wandering far and wide across the ocean, albatross will return to the same partner, perform their same secret dance and start nesting. Both parents will also contribute equally when it comes time to lay an egg and raise a chick. This sounds like the Hallmark dream, right? Wrong! While albatross are socially monogamous (meaning they will remain committed to one partner) the truth is they get around when no one else is watching. To us, this may sound like cheating, but in the world of science, it’s known as “extra-pair copulation,” or EPC.
