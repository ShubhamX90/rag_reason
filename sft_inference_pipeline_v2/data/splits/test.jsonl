Listen to this article Loading audio... India’s much-loved national anthem, ‘Jana Gana Mana’, literally translates as ‘Thou Art the Ruler of the Minds of All People’. Both words and music were written in 1911 by India’s first Nobel laureate, Rabindranath Tagore. Tagore’s original version, titled ‘Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata’ was a five-stanza Brahmo hymn written in a Sanskritized dialect of Bengali known as ‘Sadhu Bhasha’. This version was first performed in public in December 1911. The first stanza of Tagore’s anthem, which when performed lasts around 52 seconds, was officially recognised as India’s national anthem in 1950, by the Constituent Assembly of India. An even shorter version, consisting of just the first and last lines, is also sometimes staged. When India celebrated the end of British rule in 1947, the year of the Indian Independence Act, the Indian Constituent Assembly assembled for the first time as a sovereign body. They closed their meeting by joining in song, to sing ‘Jana Gana Mana’. In 2023, to mark Indian Independence Day on 15 August, a premiere performance marked the largest symphony orchestra ever to record ‘Jana Gana Mana’. Three-time Grammy Award winning Indian composer Ricky Kej led the mighty Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in a performance of the Indian national anthem at Abbey Road Studios in London (watch below).

Scientists don't yet fully understand what causes Alzheimer's disease in most people. The causes probably include a combination of age-related changes in the brain, along with genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. The importance of any one of these factors in increasing or decreasing the risk of Alzheimer's disease may differ from person to person. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disease. It is characterized by changes in the brain—including amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary, or tau, tangles—that result in loss of neurons and their connections. These and other changes affect a person’s ability to remember and think and, eventually, to live independently. Aging and Alzheimer's risk Older age does not cause Alzheimer’s, but it is the most important known risk factor for the disease. The number of people with Alzheimer’s disease doubles about every 5 years beyond age 65. About one-third of all people age 85 and older may have Alzheimer's disease. Scientists are learning how age-related changes in the brain may harm neurons and affect other types of brain cells to contribute to Alzheimer’s damage. These age-related changes include atrophy (shrinking) of certain parts of the brain, inflammation, vascular damage, production of unstable molecules called free radicals, and breakdown of energy production within cells. However, age is only one risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Many people live into their 90s and beyond without ever developing dementia. Clinical trials on Alzheimer's disease Volunteers are needed for clinical trials that are exploring why some older adults get Alzheimer’s disease. By joining one of these studies, you may learn more about the relationship between aging and Alzheimer’s and contribute useful information to help other older adults in the future.

It likely develops from multiple factors, such as genetics, lifestyle and environment. Scientists have identified factors that increase the risk of Alzheimer’s. While some risk factors — age, family history and heredity — can't be changed, emerging evidence suggests there may be other factors we can influence. Age The greatest known risk factor for Alzheimer’s and other dementias is increasing age, but these disorders are not a normal part of aging. While age increases risk, it is not a direct cause of Alzheimer's. Most individuals with the disease are 65 and older. After age 65, the risk of Alzheimer's doubles every five years. After age 85, the risk reaches nearly one-third. Family history Another strong risk factor is family history. Those who have a parent, brother or sister with Alzheimer’s are more likely to develop the disease. The risk increases if more than one family member has the illness. When diseases tend to run in families, either heredity (genetics), environmental factors, or both, may play a role. Aluminum not a cause During the 1960s and 1970s, aluminum emerged as a possible suspect in causing Alzheimer’s disease. This suspicion led to concerns about everyday exposure to aluminum through sources such as cooking pots, foil, beverage cans, antacids and antiperspirants. Since then, studies have failed to confirm any role for aluminum in causing Alzheimer’s. Almost all scientists today focus on other areas of research, and few experts believe that everyday sources of aluminum pose any threat.

A healthy lifestyle may help reduce your risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Two large, long term studies indicate that adequate physical activity, a nutritious diet, limited alcohol consumption, and not smoking may help people. To learn more about the study, you can listen to a short podcast. Changes in the brain can begin years before the first symptoms appear. Researchers are studying whether education, diet, and environment play a role in developing Alzheimer’s disease.

Here’s 8 ways. What are the warning signs of Alzheimer’s disease? Alzheimer’s disease is not a normal part of aging. Memory problems are typically one of the first warning signs of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.

His grandfather initially resisted the idea that she had Alzheimer’s disease, as spouses of patients often do, according to Patira. That denial eventually turned into frustration that there wasn’t anything they could do, Travaglini said. Old age doesn’t guarantee the development of Alzheimer’s disease — but it’s the greatest risk factor. And as the global average life span increases, Alzheimer’s disease endures as a major public health burden, and one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of modern medicine. Starting with memory impairment and cognitive decline, the disease eventually affects behavior, speech, orientation and even a person’s ability to move. Because the living human brain is complex and experiments on it are largely impossible, scientists often have to rely on rodent models of the disease that don’t always translate to humans. What’s more, patients with Alzheimer’s disease often have other types of dementias at the same time, which makes it difficult to tease apart what exactly is happening in the brain. Though we still don’t know what causes Alzheimer’s, our knowledge about the disease has grown dramatically since 1898, when Emil Redlich, a doctor at the Second Psychiatric Clinic of the University of Vienna, first used the word “plaques” to describe what he saw in the brains of two patients diagnosed with “senile dementia.” In 1907 the German psychiatrist Alois Alzheimer described the presence of plaques, tangles and atrophy visualized by a silver staining technique in the brain of Auguste Deter, a woman who had died at the age of 55 from “presenile dementia.”", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d5", "source_url": "https://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/alzheimers-causes-risk-factors", "snippet": "Causes and Risk Factors of Alzheimer's Disease Causes of Alzheimer's Disease Researchers don't know exactly what causes Alzheimer's disease.

Most of the time, the brain cells also form two types of flaws: Â Neurofibrillary tangles. These are twisted fibers inside brain cells that keep nutrients and other important things from moving from one part of the cell to another Beta-amyloid plaques. These are sticky clumps of proteins that build up between nerve cells instead of breaking down like they do in healthy brains. Plaques and tangles damage the healthy brain cells around them. The damaged cells die, and the brain shrinks. These changes cause the symptoms of Alzheimerâs, such as memory loss, speech problems, confusion, and mood swings. Brain cells affected by the disease also make lower amounts of the chemicals called neurotransmitters that nerves use to send messages to each other. Scientists don't know if these brain cell changes cause Alzheimerâs or happen because of it. What Can Lead to Alzheimer's Disease?

It's not known exactly what causes this process to begin. However, in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, scientists have found amyloid plaques (abnormal deposits of protein), neurofibrillary tangles (containing tau) and imbalances in a chemical called acetylcholine. It's also common to have a degree of vascular damage in the brain. These reduce the effectiveness of healthy neurons (nerve cells that carry messages to and from the brain), gradually destroying them. Over time, this damage spreads to several areas of the brain. The first areas affected are responsible for memories. Increased risk Although it's still unknown what triggers Alzheimer's disease, several factors are known to increase your risk of developing the condition. Age Age is the single most significant factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease. The likelihood of developing the condition doubles every five years after you reach 65 years of age. However, it's not just older people who are at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Around 1 in 20 people with the condition are under 65. This is called early onset Alzheimer's disease and it can affect people from around the age of 40. Family history The genes you inherit from your parents can contribute to your risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, although the actual increase in risk is small if you have a close family member with the condition. However, in a few families, Alzheimer's disease is caused by the inheritance of a single gene, and the risks of the condition being passed on are much higher.

It is written in the voice of a newlywed girl, sung to her new husband. It has since become her signature song. Background Fargo told Tom Roland in The Billboard Book of Number One Country Hits that she wrote the song with a different title originally. \"It really started out to be 'Happiest Girl in the World,' but the rhyme scheme got to be too unnatural, so I changed it to 'U.S.A.' It kind of wrote itself after that. \"[1] Copyright infringement rumor A rumor later circulated that the line \"skip-a-dee-doo-dah\" was originally written as \"zip-a-dee-doo-dah,\" and that the Walt Disney Company subsequently sued Fargo as soon as they became aware of the song and its line, demanding that the original line be changed. Fargo has since put the rumor to rest, stating that \"skip-a-dee-doo-dah\" was indeed the original line and that no such lawsuit ever took place.[citation needed] Critical reception Commercial performance The song, Fargo's first single on Dot Records, became a No. 1 country hit in the spring of 1972, and subsequently became a hit on the Billboard Hot 100 pop music chart, peaking at No. 11, and Billboard Easy Listening Singles chart, where it reached No. 7.

She is a beautiful and spiritual human being who loves her country and fellow human beings. Donna Fargo: Still The Happiest Girl In The Whole U.S.A. In November of 1972, I was eight years old, and my grandparents lived about a mile away from our house in Valdosta, Georgia. The Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade in New York City was coming on television, and between our licking beaters of cake or pudding, I remember my grandmother’s alto voice yelling, “Y’all get in here. Donna Fargo’s gonna sing ‘The Happiest Girl in the Whole U.S.A.’ from one of the parade floats”. It was certainly a song we all knew because our mom had bought the 33 1/3 speed album and played it over and over on our record player. We knew all the words. We also knew all the words to “Funny Face”, and through the years, I think we memorized the words to all the songs on that album. I imagined the record player’s needle wore grooves in the vinyl disc. Today, I still have that Donna Fargo album I play on my record player, and I listen to her CDs in my SUV and on my office computer. Recently, I wondered if Donna Fargo was still “The Happiest Girl in the Whole U.S.A” and after interviewing her, I learned she most definitely is. Donna tells us in one of her books, “If you’re not happy, you’re cheating yourself.” Now, fifty years after several major #1 hits, several awards, and much more, Donna has written over two thousand greeting cards and over eight books for Blue Mountain while continuing to write and record music. Her most recent CD is All Because of You and has some incredible songs such as “One of the Good Guys”. Released by PrimaDonna Entertainment, it was produced by Donna’s long-time husband/producer Stan Silver who unfortunately passed away from COVID complications during the pandemic. Donna also suffered with COVID, previously had two strokes, and has fought a long battle with M.S., but despite having those huge mountains to climb, she has remained positive and has continued to work.", "timestamp": "2023-08-27"}, {"doc_id": "d7", "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vw7OSXPkDc", "snippet": "Donna Fargo \"Happiest Girl in the Whole USA\" - YouTube Donna Fargo \"Happiest Girl in the Whole USA\". 202K views · 4 years ago ...

{"id": "#0059", "query": "Is there sound in space?", "conflict_type": "No conflict", "gold_answer": "Yes", "retrieved_docs": [{"doc_id": "d1", "source_url": "https://cosmosmagazine.com/space/astronomy/explainer-is-there-sound-in-space/", "snippet": "Explainer: Is there sound in space? No, there isn’t sound in space. Sound doesn’t exist in space, at least not the way we experience it on Earth. This is because sound travels through the vibration of particles, and space is a vacuum. On Earth, sound mainly travels to your ears by way of vibrating air molecules, but in near-empty regions of space there are no (or very, very few) particles to vibrate – so no sound. We’re lucky that’s the case, because otherwise the sound of the Sun would roar at an impressive 100 decibels to us on Earth – like hearing a rock concert all day every day. Sound travels in what’s known as a longitudinal wave, which causes back-and-forth vibration of the particles in the medium through which it is moving. It propagates through a medium at the speed of sound which varies from substance to substance – generally more slowly through gases, faster in liquids, and fastest in solids. This back and forth causes regions of high pressure where particles are compressed together (compressions) and regions of low pressure where they are more spread apart (rarefactions). The distance it takes to complete one wave cycle – for instance, the distance between each repeating compression – is what’s known as its wavelength. Sound waves are longitudinal waves. Credit: VectorMine/Getty Images The frequency of the wave is measured in hertz (Hz), which is a measure of the number of waves that pass through a fixed point in a second. So, the longer the wavelength the lower the frequency, and vice versa. Human beings can usually hear sounds within a narrow range of frequencies, usually between 20Hz and 20,000Hz. So, what are we hearing in Astroturf? This short film is just one part of a greater anthology, where independent filmmakers were challenged by the Space Sound Effects (SSFX) project to create short films which incorporated sounds recorded in space by satellites. Now, although we just reminded ourselves that space is a vacuum, it should be clarified that it isn’t completely empty.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d2", "source_url": "https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3p3dv/nasa-has-captured-actual-sound-in-space-and-its-honestly-terrifying", "snippet": "NASA Has Captured 'Actual Sound' in Space and It's Honestly ... In space, no one can hear you scream, the saying goes, because sound waves can’t travel through the vacuum that extends across most of the universe. However, space can be downright noisy in the right conditions, such as the hot gas surrounding the immense black hole at the center of the Perseus galaxy cluster, according to NASA. The agency recently tweeted an eerie audio clip that represents actual sound waves rippling through the gas and plasma in this cluster, which is 250 million light years from Earth. \"The misconception that there is no sound in space originates because most space is a ~vacuum, providing no way for sound waves to travel,\" the agency tweeted. \"A galaxy cluster has so much gas that we've picked up actual sound. Here it's amplified, and mixed with other data, to hear a black hole!\" Though the acoustic signals generated by the black hole were first identified in 2003 in data from NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory, they have never been brought into the hearing range of the human ear—until now. “In some ways, this sonification is unlike any other done before… because it revisits the actual sound waves discovered in data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory,” NASA said in a statement. “In this new sonification of Perseus, the sound waves astronomers previously identified were extracted and made audible for the first time.” As it turns out, the sound waves in their natural environment are a whopping 57 octaves below the note middle C, making this black hole a real cosmic baritone. To make these tremors audible to humans, scientists raised their frequencies quadrillions of times (one quadrillion is a million billions, for perspective).

Does sound travel faster in space? Sound does not travel at all in space. The vacuum of outer space has essentially zero air. Because sound is just vibrating air, space has no air to vibrate and therefore no sound. If you are sitting in a space ship and another space ship explodes, you would hear nothing. Exploding bombs, crashing asteroids, supernovas, and burning planets would similarly be silent in space. In a space ship, you could of course hear the other passengers because your ship is filled with air. Additionally, a living human will always be able to hear himself talk, breath, and circulate blood, because the air in his space suit which sustains his life also transmits sound. But two astronauts in space suits floating around in space will not be able to talk to each other directly no matter how hard they yell, even if they are only inches away. Their inability to talk directly is not caused by their helmets getting in the way, but is rather caused by the vacuum of space not carrying sound at all. That is why space suits are equipped with two-way radio communicators. Radio is a form of electromagnetic radiation just like light and can therefore travel through the vacuum of space just fine. The astronaut's transmitter converts the sound waveform to a radio waveform and sends the radio waves through space to the other astronaut, where is it converted back to sound for the other human to hear. I suspect the entertainment industry portrays this principle incorrectly on purpose for dramatic effect. A silent exploding space ship is not as dramatic as a booming one.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d4", "source_url": "https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/sound-in-space", "snippet": "Is there sound in space? - BBC Sky at Night Magazine The results of this ongoing collision were revealed by the observations from Chandra to be immense circular ripples, spreading out in all directions, like those created by an object dropped into water. These ripples, or pressure waves, obey the same laws as sound waves and, even though no one can hear them, they are true sound waves travelling through very thin gas in space. Just as on Earth, where the pitch of a musical note created in air depends on either the sound’s wavelength, or the distance between each ripple of compression, the same is true of the Perseus black hole. The ripples seen by Chandra are 35,000 lightyears apart. Dubbed ‘the deepest note in the Universe’, this is what you would get if you could make a musical note 57 octaves below middle C.

The sounds made by black holes have not been directly heard – they have not travelled through space to the Earth as sound waves. Rather we can see the effect they have on the gas surrounding them using X-rays, like using visible light to witness the waves when a stone is dropped into a pond. A normal piano covers seven octaves of musical notes, but the Perseus black hole sings some 57 octaves below middle C – or more than a million billion times deeper than the range of human hearing. These sound waves are more than a curiosity, and may help explain how galactic clusters grow. It has been a long-standing puzzle to astronomers as to why there should be so much hot gas in clusters of galaxies. It would normally be expected to cool and fall towards the centre of the galaxies, forming lots of new stars as it clumps together. Heat from a large central black hole could be the answer. The jets of material streaming from the Perseus black hole form cavities in the thin cluster gas as they collide with it. Sound waves then travel outwards as huge ripples.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d5", "source_url": "https://www.scienceabc.com/nature/universe/how-has-nasa-recorded-sound-if-sound-cannot-travel-in-space.html", "snippet": "If Sound Cannot Travel In Space How Has NASA Recorded Sound? These vibrations are passed on to consecutive particles in the medium, meaning that sound waves cannot travel without a medium. The reason we can’t hear sound in the space is typically due to a lack of such a medium. We may argue that there are clouds of gases in space that can act as mediums, but gases are not present uniformly throughout the space. Moreover, gases are typically less dense in space, which means there is too large of a gap between the particles, so vibrations cannot travel efficiently. How Do Scientists Hear The Sounds Of The Universe? To begin with, scientists cannot actually ‘hear’ space sounds, but they do have the means to examine the space waves by converting them into sound waves. Sonification Sonification is the conversion of any non-auditory data into sound, and is analogous to data visualization. A conversion technique is called Sonification if it fulfills certain criteria: Reproducibility, i.e., important elements of the data remain the same, regardless of the conditions under which the Sonification is done. The data should be sonified in a way that even untrained listeners can make a distinction. Space is full of radio waves, plasma waves, magnetic waves, gravitational waves and shock waves, all of which can travel in space without a medium. These waves are recorded by instruments that can sense these waves, and the data is transferred to earth-based stations, where the waves are sound coded. Any audible sound has variables like frequency, amplitude and rhythm. Different space waves are matched with different properties of the sound (frequency, amplitude, etc.) in different proportions to get a sound. EMFISIS NASA has an instrument called the EMFISIS (Electric and Magnetic Field Instrument Suite and Integrated Science) plugged in to its two Van Allen Probe spacecraft that measures magnetic and electric interference as they circle the earth. There are three electric sensors that measure the electric disturbances and three magnetrons that measure the fluctuations in magnetic fields. Some of the electromagnetic waves lie in the audible frequency range, which works as a base for scientists to translate the remaining recorded frequencies in the audible range in order to interpret data.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d6", "source_url": "https://www.sciencealert.com/sound-can-travel-through-space-after-all-but-we-can-t-hear-it", "snippet": "Sound Can Travel Through Space After All - But We Can't Hear It ... Sound Can Travel Through Space After All – But We Can't Hear It It's a fact well-known enough to be the tagline to the 1979 sci-fi horror blockbuster Alien: \"In space, no one can hear you scream.\" Or to put it another way, sound can't be carried in the empty vacuum of space - there just aren't any molecules for the audio vibrations to move through. Well, that is true: but only up to a point. As it turns out, space isn't a complete and empty void, though large swathes of it are. The interstellar gas and dust left behind by old stars and sometimes used to create new ones does have the potential to carry sound waves - we just aren't able to listen to them. The particles are so spread out, and the resulting sound waves are of such a low frequency, that they're beyond the capabilities of human hearing. As Kiona Smith-Strickland explains at Gizmodo, sounds travel as molecules bump into each other, the same way that ripples spread out when you drop a stone into a pond: as the ripples get farther and farther away, the sound gradually loses its force, which is why we can only hear sounds generated near to us. As a sound wave passes, it causes oscillations in the air pressure, and the time between these oscillations represents the frequency of the sound (measured in Hertz); the distance between the oscillating peaks is the wavelength. If the distance between the air particles is greater than this wavelength, the sound can't bridge the gap and the 'ripples' stop. Therefore, sounds have to have a wide wavelength - which would come across as a low pitch to our ears - in order to make it from one particle to the next out in certain parts of space. Once sounds go below 20 Hz, they become infrasounds, and we can't hear them. One example noted by Gizmodo is of a black hole, which emanates the lowest note scientists know about so far: it's about 57 octaves below middle C and well below our hearing range (about a million billion times deeper than the sounds we can hear).", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d7", "source_url": "https://gizmodo.com/there-actually-is-sound-in-outer-space-1738420340", "snippet": "There Actually Is Sound in Outer Space Space isn’t uniform nothingness. It’s full of stuff. In between the stars, there are clouds of gas and dust. These clouds are sometimes the remains of old stars that went out in a blaze of explosive glory, and they’re the regions where new stars form. And some of that interstellar gas is dense enough to carry sound waves, just not sound perceptible to humans. Advertisement Here’s How It Works When an object moves — whether it’s a vibrating guitar string or an exploding firecracker — it pushes on the air molecules closest to it. Those displaced molecules bump into their neighbors, and then those displaced molecules bump into their neighbors. The motion travels through the air as a wave. When the wave reaches your ear, you perceive it as sound. Advertisement Advertisement As a sound wave passes through the air, the air pressure in any given spot will oscillate up and down; picture the way water gets deeper and shallower as waves pass by. The time between those oscillations is called the sound’s frequency, and it’s measured in units called Hertz; one Hertz is one oscillation per second. The distance between “peaks” of high pressure is called the sound’s wavelength. Advertisement Sound waves can only travel through a medium if the length of the wave is longer than the average distance between the particles. Physicists call this the “mean free path” — the average distance a molecule can travel after colliding with one molecule and before colliding with the next. So a denser medium can carry sounds with shorter wavelengths, and vice versa. Sounds with longer wavelengths, of course, have lower frequencies, which we perceive as lower pitches. In any gas with a mean free path larger than 17 m (the wavelength of sounds with a frequency of 20 Hz), the waves that propagate will be too low-frequency for us to hear them. These sound waves are called infrasound.

NASA announced in September that Voyager 1 had left the heliosphere in August 2012. The heliosphere is a sheath of magnetic influence that emanates from the sun and expands through a stream of charged particles called the solar wind. At the press conference, Don Gurnett, the principal investigator for Voyager 1's plasma wave science instrument, demonstrated a series of sounds the instrument had picked up. \"Strictly speaking, the plasma wave instrument does not detect sound. Instead, it senses waves of electrons in the ionized gas or 'plasma' that Voyager travels through,\" NASA stated in a statement.

Light waves travel through space hence they reach earth and they also use vibration of particle to transport energy. It seems like these two ideas are contracting themselves. Maybe the thing I don't understand is why longitudinal waves such as sound have to travel through a media. $\\begingroup$If you mean a perfect vacuum, then there is nothing to displace. However, \"space\" is not a vacuum. It is, as you say, filled with particles, admittedly a low density, but space is not empty. Longitudinal waves can exist in space, but not in a vacuum. Note also that sound cannot be said to exist in space for two reasons. 1.) sound is a psychophysical phenomenon that exist only in the human brain. 2) the longitudinal waves in space are have a very low frequency that no human could hear.$\\endgroup$ $\\begingroup$@garyp - Actually there are electrostatic ion-acoustic waves, which are a longitudinal (i.e., $\\mathbf{k} \\times \\delta \\mathbf{E} = 0$) sound wave, that oscillate near the ion plasma frequency. In the solar wind near Earth, this corresponds to ~100-1000 Hz in the plasma rest frame. In a spacecraft frame (which is basically at rest compared to the plasma), the waves can be Doppler shifted up to ~1-10 kHz. We can convert these signals directly to an audio signal. The University of Iowa has done a bunch of this for various plasma waves.$\\endgroup$ 2 Answers 2 Electromagnetic waves are produced by oscillating charged particles but they do not need other particles to propagate.

When it mattered most, though, the ball ended up in grateful Kiwi hands and the defending champions were safe. Given England have had the benefit of full-time contracts for longer than any of their rivals, it must also rank as one of the great coaching heists. When Wayne Smith took over earlier this year, the Black Ferns were in disarray after a coruscating review into the treatment of the players by the previous regime. Smith simply told his players to go out and play with freedom and joy. The rest is history. A world-record crowd of 42,579 for a women’s fixture added further resonance to an occasion which had everything. Neither side really deserved to lose but New Zealand’s sixth try of the night with eight minutes left, scored by the replacement wing Ayesha Leti-I’iga after a world-class offload from the centre Stacey Fluhler, was something special.

The All Blacks’ sisters, the New Zealand Black Ferns – the women’s national side - are the winningest team in the world, with a win percentage of nearly 90%. In 2022, after a year of postponement, Aotearoa New Zealand hosted the Women’s Rugby World Cup. The sporting spectacle took place over one month, between 8 October and 12 November, with three venues being used. The World Cup was a great success with over 150,000 fans attending the 26 matches. The tournament also produced one of the greatest test matches in rugby history, with the Black Ferns knocking off the tournament favorites England en route to a historic sixth World Cup title. More importantly, the sporting event captured the attention of the nation as symbolized by the record-setting crowd of 42,579 fans in attendance for the final. In a sport so dominated by physicality and brawn, it is no surprise that the emphasis has traditionally been placed on men’s participation. But the Women’s Rugby World Cup showed that more is possible. At a time when rugby participation numbers are declining – Statista shows 133,600 players participating in England in 2021 compared to 259,600 in 2016 – there is proof to show that opening the game up to women is the true opportunity to grow the game. Equal opportunity in rugby has long been an issue. The men’s game professionalized in the 1990s, but it was not until 2018 that some of the Black Ferns received semi-professional contracts. In the run-up to their hosting of the World Cup, the Black Ferns were heavily criticized for poor performances, losing an unprecedented four times in a row, and receiving their heaviest ever losses at the hands of tournament favorites England.

The 2014 Games achieved a record broadcast audience of 2.1 billion people worldwide.[1] Cost and financing As of October 2013, the estimated combined cost of the 2014 Winter Olympics had topped US$51 billion.[9] This amount included the cost for Olympic games themselves and cost of Sochi infrastructural projects (roads, railroads, power plants). This total is over four times the initial budget of $12 billion (compared to the $8 billion spent for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver), and made the Sochi games the most expensive Olympics in history, exceeding the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing,[10] which hosted 3 times as many events.[11]Dmitry Kozak was the main overseer for the events in Sochi.[12][13][14]", "timestamp": "2024-12-21"}, {"doc_id": "d2", "source_url": "https://www.britannica.com/event/Sochi-2014-Olympic-Winter-Games", "snippet": "Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games | Sports, Venues & Results The Sochi Games marked the first time that the Winter Olympics were held in Russia.

The history of the Olympics: From ancient Greece to nowThe first Olympic Games consisted of a singular event: a footrace. The Sochi Olympics featured approximately 2,800 athletes from 88 National Olympic Committees (NOCs), which was a record for the most participating NOCs in the Winter Olympics. The athletes participated in the most events in Winter Games history—98, which included 12 new events, notably women’s ski jumping and slopestyle (a combination of downhill racing and the tricks of freestyle) disciplines of skiing and snowboarding for both men and women. The most-dominant showing by a single country in one sport at any Winter Games took place in speed skating at Sochi as the Dutch team shattered the Olympic record by winning 23 of the 36 medals that were awarded in the sport. (The previous record holder was the Austrian Alpine skiing team that won 14 medals at the Turin 2006 Olympic Winter Games.) The most-decorated athlete of the 2014 Olympics was Dutch speed skater Ireen Wüst, who tallied five total medals (two golds and three silvers). Her countryman Sven Kramer added to his career Olympic medal count by taking two golds (both in Olympic record time) and one silver. In short-track speed skating, Russia’s Viktor Ahn (who previously competed in the Olympics for South Korea under his given name, Ahn Hyun-Soo) won three gold medals to increase his lifetime Olympic tally to six and establish himself as arguably the greatest short-track speed skater of all time. Russia finished the Games with the most gold medals (13) and the most overall medals (33).", "timestamp": "2024-11-16"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "source_url": "https://stillmed.olympic.org/media/Document%20Library/OlympicOrg/Games/Winter-Games/Games-Sochi-2014-Winter-Olympic-Games/Facts-and-Figures/Factsheet-Facts-and-Figures-Sochi-2014.pdf", "snippet": "[PDF] factsheet - sochi 2014 facts & figures - Olympics.com 88 NOCs participated in the Sochi.

In October 1986, the IOC had voted to hold the Olympic Winter Games halfway through the four-year Olympiad, rather than in the same year as the summer Games,[22] and this change started with the XVIIth Olympic Winter Games in 1994 in Lillehammer, Norway.

Today, there are ten such territories with Olympic Nation status: Click to enlarge: Dependent territories and partially recognized sovereign states admitted to the Olympics.

The Dutch hegemony was accompanied by a dismal showing by the USA speed skaters who were shut out of the medals in the sport for only the second time ever at the Winter Olympics, after that had occurred in 1984. In men’s biathlon, Norway’s Ole Einar Bjørndalen set an all-time Olympic record by winning 2 medals, giving him 13 for his career, the most ever won at the Winter Olympics, bettering the mark of 12 by his countryman Bjørn Dæhlie in cross-country skiing. On the women’s side, cross-country skier Marit Bjørgen won 3 gold medals, giving her 10 medals all-time, equalling the female Winter Olympic record held by Italy’s Stefania Belmondo and the Soviet Union’s Raisa Smetanina, both cross-country skiers. As the Games proceeded, troubling political news came from nearby Ukraine, where protests and revolts erupted, as the people of Ukraine supported lending their allegiance to the European Union, opposing the government’s desire to align with Russia. While that could be an innocuous decision in some countries it was not for Ukraine, as shortly after Sochi ended, Russian troops took control of the Krym (Crimea), a Ukrainian peninsula in the Black Sea, less than 100 miles from Sochi. Putin supported the Russian incursion by stating it was necessary to protect ethnic Russians in the area.

Instructors claim that if you only knew the right moves, your trouble zones would disappear and your body would be dimple-free. But can certain exercises really get rid of cellulite? The verdict: Exercise can reduce fat, but there’s no way to spot-treat cellulite According to Hundt, the keys to a good anti-cellulite training program are: losing body fat, firming the muscle underneath the skin, following a low-carb diet, and boosting circulation and blood flow. Here are her tips for doing all of that: Circulation Enhance your circulation by getting massages and doing regular exercise that involves strength training and cardio. Taking showers that switch from hot to cold can also boost circulation. Diet Eating a low-fat diet consisting of lean proteins and veggies is one way to lose body fat. Avoid sugar, starches, alcohol, processed foods and sugary fruit. Lowering your carb intake will also help: Foods with a low glycemic index have been shown to aid in weight loss, according to the Harvard School of Public Health. Cardio Interval training – which involves varying the intensity of your activity – is a great way to burn body fat. Strength training Firming the muscle underneath the cellulite will help smooth the skin’s appearance. Focus on strength-training moves that build up the hamstrings, quads, buttocks and hips.

Is It Possible To Get Rid of Cellulite With Exercises? Cellulite is a natural part of the human body and affects up to 80–90% of people, especially women (1). However, it’s been labeled a “problem” that we’re conditioned to think we need to get rid of, mostly thanks to endless photo editing that showcases smooth, flawless skin. Unfortunately this has led to many people wishing to get rid of their cellulite. To be perfectly candid, it’s not possible to get rid of cellulite with exercise alone. Even the most lean people can have visible cellulite. That said, there are things you can do to reduce the appearance of cellulite, which may help you feel more confident in your skin. This article dives deep into cellulite, provides useful tips to reduce its appearance, and offers lower body exercises that will help you grow your strength and confidence, regardless. While exercise can be a useful tool in reducing the appearance of cellulite, it can’t completely get rid of it. What exercise will do is make the muscles under your cellulite stronger. The stronger your muscles are, the better you’ll feel. And the better you feel, the more confidence you’ll have — which will hopefully help you look beyond cellulite and focus on your power, instead. Cellulite is visible subcutaneous fat that creates a “dimpled” or “orange-peel” appearance. It’s mostly found on the buttocks and thighs. The third layer, known as the hypodermis, consists of a fatty tissue (known as subcutaneous fat) which stores energy (i.e., fat), provides protection and insulation, and attaches the upper layers of skin to muscle and fascia (2, 3). Just above the hypodermis sits a layer of connective tissue, mostly made of collagen. In some cases, fat may protrude through these collagen fibers and cause a dimpled appearance. Sometimes losing body fat and increasing muscle mass may help to reduce the appearance of cellulite. However, even very lean individuals can still have visible cellulite (4).", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d4", "source_url": "https://www.nivea.co.uk/advice/skin/how-to-get-rid-of-cellulite", "snippet": "How to get rid of cellulite | Advice | NIVEA Exercising regularly will help to increase your blood flow and burn fat - both things that will help to get rid of cellulite. 5) WEAR TIGHT CLOTHING LESS OFTEN TO REDUCE CELLULITE Wearing compression clothing for too long and too often can restrict our blood circulation, meaning cellulite is more likely to appear. 6) USE A SKIN-STRENGTHENING CREAM TO REDUCE CELLULITE Whilst the root cause of cellulite is deeper than just the skin, having weak, sagging and undernourished skin can make it appear much worse.

At Advanced Aesthetics Med Spa of Ocala, many of our patients are curious about whether or not they can get rid of cellulite by just dieting and exercising. One would assume so, but is it really that simple? Keep reading to learn a little more about this frequently asked question. Can Diet and Exercise be the Answer to All of My Cellulite Problems? The truth is that while diet and exercise do play a part in the amount and type of visible cellulite you have, these two things are not effective cellulite treatments in and of themselves. In fact, if you go on a crash diet and drastically reduce the number of calories you eat in a day, you will most likely regain your lost weight within the first 6 months after you give up the diet. The reason behind yo-yo weight fluctuations that occur when you participate in extremely low- calorie diets is that when you drastically decrease calories you not only reduce the fat in your body, but you also experience muscle loss. Not only that, but when you suddenly make a huge change in your calorie intake, your body responds by entering survival mode and conserving fat, and that’s definitely not what you want. When it comes to exercise, many people assume that they need to run their fat off. While cardio is incredibly beneficial to your health, if your goal is to burn fat, you should concentrate on strength training in order to build muscle mass. Weight training is proven to be much more effective at burning fat than cardio exercises are.

No, you can't get rid of cellulite with exercise, because you can't \"tone\" or target a specific muscle. For your thighs to look tighter, you'll need to lose body fat, which happens all over your body. Sure, losing fat and gaining some muscle might make your dimpling look less prominent or noticeable, but it'll take major consistency and an overall lifestyle change rather than a few simple exercises, and even then, this still won't entirely \"get rid of\" cellulite.

How can exercise help us get rid of it? Answer: You and your friends may take small comfort in knowing you’re among the vast majority of women who experience the dreaded dimpling of cellulite. While it’s known to affect some men, cellulite is infamous for plaguing women with the “cottage-cheese” or “orange-peel” effect on the thighs, hips and buttocks. It’s most obvious in these areas because that’s where fat tends to accumulate in women. And while doctors say cellulite is just that — ordinary fat — the term is widely used to describe the lumpy skin appearance that can result from a combination of factors: too much fat, too little muscle, thinning skin and connective tissue beneath the skin that separates fat cells into pockets. Exercise can reduce cellulite Exercise can help minimize cellulite by burning off fat and building muscle, says Wayne Westcott, fitness research director at the South Shore YMCA in Quincy, Mass. Because fat is very soft tissue, it doesn’t keep the legs looking firm, smooth and shapely like muscle does. Physical fitness is particularly important in fighting cellulite as women age, he says, because each decade they lose about 5 pounds of muscle and gain 15 pounds of fat.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d8", "source_url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/body/fitness-workouts/a34976777/cellulite-exercise/", "snippet": "Can exercise get ever get rid of cellulite? | An expert verdict Ever wondered if exercise can get rid of cellulite?

But before we get into it, a top-line: cellulite isn't 'too much fat', rather, a physical trait most women have. It's caused by weaker connective tissue and larger fat cells around women's thighs and hips which we carry, why? You guessed it: for childbearing reasons. 93% of women are affected by cellulite, and a shocking 60% of women surveyed believe it's down to their lifestyle. But news flash: cellulite is normal, and definitely not caused by anything you can control. According to personal trainer Leigh Clayton, nearly all women will have cellulite, but how it shows will differ from person-to-person. That is, your best mate could have it under her skin, it just may not show on the surface.

Sure, logic might suggest that reducing your body fat percentage will reduce the amount of cellulite that you have, but realistically, the human body is far more complex than that, the PT explains. \"Removing it completely is unrealistic and unlikely.

Honest, science-based and straight to the point, without clichés or even dangerous misinformation that you find all over the internet. Just science-based, actionable information. Do cellulite exercises work? Can exercise get rid of cellulite on legs? First things first: in most cases you cannot get rid of cellulite completely with any method of any kind, including exercise. Of course, the answer to the, more correct, question \"does exercise reduce cellulite?\", is yes. exercise is one of the most important ways to reduce cellulite, not just because it makes you burn calories, but also because it boosts your circulation and promotes skin firming. However, too many people, instead of looking for an effective workout for cellulite, they look for specific leg cellulite exercises, which, as we will see below, is completely the wrong way to go about it. Images of so-called “cellulite exercises”, according to the “wisdom” of the internet First off, if you are looking for specific leg cellulite removal exercises, i.e. exercises to remove cellulite from a specific area of your legs, for example your inner thighs, back of thighs etc, let me warn you that you are looking for something that does not exist: spot fat reduction (including cellulite fat) with exercise is biologically impossible, so all these exercises you see on the internet are utter BS (and that’s the best word I can use about them).

Fortunately, several proven strategies lessen the appearance of troublesome cellulite. Lifestyle Changes and Exercise Adopting a healthy lifestyle and engaging in regular exercise can significantly improve the appearance of cellulite. Focus on maintaining a balanced diet, staying hydrated, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. Incorporating targeted exercises like squats, lunges, and cardio workouts can help tone the muscles and reduce the visibility of cellulite. You can take a step towards smoother skin by making these simple lifestyle changes. Topical Creams Some over-the-counter and prescription creams contain ingredients like caffeine, retinol, and antioxidants, which can temporarily improve the appearance of cellulite by tightening the skin and increasing blood flow. While these creams may not provide long-term results, they can offer some short-term improvement. Body Brushing Dry brushing or body brushing with a soft-bristled brush can improve circulation, stimulate the lymphatic system, and exfoliate the skin. Regular body brushing may help reduce fluid retention and the appearance of cellulite. Massage and Manual Lymphatic Drainage Specialized massage techniques, like lymphatic drainage, can help reduce fluid retention and improve circulation, potentially reducing the appearance of cellulite. Massage also aids in breaking down fat cells and improving skin elasticity. Non-Invasive Treatments For more targeted cellulite reduction, non-invasive treatments have shown promising results. Technologies such as radiofrequency, ultrasound, and laser therapy stimulate collagen production, tighten the skin, and break down fat cells.

You don't have to be overweight to have cellulite, though this is a common misconception. General advice: Having cellulite isn't dangerous, so unless it's a major cosmetic concern, you don't have to get rid of it. Misinformation surrounds cellulite, and a 2020 survey shows that a lot of physicians want people to know that having cellulite is not their fault. While it's impossible to get rid of cellulite completely, there are some ways you can reduce its appearance. \"None of these options will permanently get rid of cellulite because they do not address the root cause of it, which are the fibrous bands under the surface of the skin,\" says Anne Chapas, MD, founder and medical director of Union Square Laser Dermatology. 1. Exercise regularly Lack of physical activity can increase the appearance of cellulite. \"Skin looks smoother and firmer over muscle rather than fat, so exercises that help replace fat with muscle can make cellulite less noticeable,\" says Little. Cellulite usually forms around the hips, thighs, and buttocks because people tend to have more fatty deposits in those areas, says Chapas. Here are some exercises that target those muscles: Wayne L. Westcott, PhD, the chair of exercise science at Quincy College, also suggests hamstring exercises — such as leg curls and leg presses, or dumbbell step-ups or dumbbell lunges, to help keep cellulite in check. 2. Give yourself a deep massage There is little evidence that massage can tighten or improve the appearance of cellulite long-term, says Kormeili.

Unfortunately, this is incorrect. Contrary to popular belief, cellulite is not a result of excess fat. Cellulite is caused by structural problems beneath the skin— which means that diet and exercise can’t always solve the problem. What is Cellulaze Cellulite Treatment? Cellulaze is a laser based treatment which corrects the causes of cellulite in a minimally invasive, one-time procedure. Patients in the Cumberland, Hagerstown, and Morgantown areas can now experience the effects Cellulaze. This new technology goes beyond traditional treatments for cellulite and offers a new approach to cellulite treatment that doesn’t blame the problem on excess fat. Instead, it addresses the structure of the tissue beneath the skin, treating the root of the problem and achieving lasting results. What Happens During Treatment? Cellulaze is a minimally-invasive procedure that uses an effective, laser-assisted cannula under local anesthesia. It works primarily in three steps: the first step uses laser energy to melt the bulging “lumps” of fat. The second step thermally divides the deep, dimple producing, fibrotic bands that pull down on the skin. The third step delivers laser energy to the dermis, producing thicker skin and increased elasticity. Cellulaze not only treats cellulite, but also jumpstarts your skin to naturally prevent it in the future. What is the Recovery Like? A Cellulaze procedure can take around 1-2 hours, depending on the area being treated.

Cellulite affects the vast majority of women. Many believe cellulite to be a fat problem that can be eliminated through diet and exercise. But, as you may have learned through experience, you may lessen the appearance of cellulite by losing weight, but you can't get rid of it completely. And crash diets can actually make it worse. It's not your fault. Fat isn't the main problem. It's a structural issue below the skin that only your physician can treat. Men typically don't get cellulite, because the structure of their skin is different from women's. This also explains why even very thin women can get cellulite, and why some heavier women don't. Cellulaze is the first cellulite treatment that attacks the structure of cellulite for clinically proven, longer-lasting results. WHAT CAUSES CELLULITE? There are three structural problems that cause the appearance of cellulite. First, connective tissue bands that tether the skin to the deeper tissue can become tight. Second, enlarged pockets of fat trapped by the rigid bands push up against skin. Finally, thin skin makes the appearance of cellulite even worse. And you know what that means-the dimpled, orange peel look that makes you cringe. Other factors associated with cellulite are aging, heredity, hormones and weight. Any effective cellulite treatment has to address more than fat and the surface of skin. Cellulaze is the first cellulite treatment that attacks the structure of cellulite, for longer-lasting results. HOW IS CELLULAZE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER CELLULITE TREATMENTS? Creams, lotions, pills and many other cellulite treatments must be used repetitively to treat the appearance of cellulite.

Effective Strategies to Reduce Cellulite While it may not be possible to completely get rid of cellulite, there are several strategies that can help minimize its appearance: Maintain a Healthy Diet: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains can support overall skin health and reduce the appearance of cellulite. Stay Hydrated: Drinking an adequate amount of water can help improve skin elasticity and reduce the appearance of cellulite.

What You Need To Know About The Connection Between Cellulite And Weight Loss When you lose weight, you'd probably expect that you'd lose (or at least reduce the appearance of) your cellulite, too. But, unfortunately, that's often not the case. What gives? John Layke M.D., a board-certified plastic surgeon and practitioner at the Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery Group, explains that cellulite is caused by fibrous bands that attach to the underside of the skin, causing the dimpling (think of a pin cushion—it's like the pins are the fibrous band). Cellulite is incredibly common—studies estimate that 80 to 90 percent of women have it. But what causes it varies person to person, says Jennifer Caudle, D.O., a family physician and Associate Professor at Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine. She says that how much cellulite a person has depends on a number of factors, including genetics, age, skin thickness, sex, and the amount of fat on the body. Caudle notes that people of all weights and sizes can and do have cellulite. Case in point? Back in August, actress Hilary Duff hit back at body-shamers who criticized her for having cellulite. \"My body has given me the greatest gift of my life: Luca, 5 years ago. I'm turning 30 in September and my body is healthy and gets me where I need to go,\" Hilary wrote in the caption. The bottom line: Losing weight won't automatically get rid of cellulite, but Layke does say that diet and exercise could maybe help reduce the appearance over time. He recommends high-intensity workouts, which provide a mixture of fat loss and muscle toning. This can cause the layer of fat under your skin to decrease in thickness, also decreasing the tautness of the fibrous bands. But again, cellulite might never go away completely simply because of your body's makeup. Research suggests that there's a genetic component to cellulite, meaning it can't necessarily be eliminated through exercise alone.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d19", "source_url": "https://www.webmd.com/beauty/get-rid-of-cellulite", "snippet": "Can You Get Rid of Cellulite? Healthy Treatments and What to Avoid. Shrink fat, build muscle People of all sizes can have cellulite. But if youâre overweight, the most effective treatment is to shed extra pounds and tone your body. Eat less and add more cardio and strength training exercise. Lift weights at least 2 days a week. Focus on your legs, hips, and backside. Strong, defined muscles under a thinner fat layer will make your skin smoother and less puckered. Subcision This minimally invasive procedure can improve your cellulite. Results have been shown to last for at least 2 years. The doctor marks the area, injects a numbing solution, and then inserts a tiny blade to cut the connective tissue that holds your fat onto those dimples. A hand-held device called Cellfina was approved in 2015 to make this procedure more precise. It provides vacuum-assisted control of the depth and area treated. About 20 to 30 individual cellulite dimples are treated during an average 1-hour session. Results can last up to 2 years. Topical products A variety of creams on the market claim to reduce cellulite. Many have ingredients intended to promote fat breakdown (caffeine, aminophylline, theophylline). Others contain vitamins, minerals, and herbal extracts. Generally, these products offer little benefit alone, but they may add some value when combined with other treatments. Some evidence suggests that retinol cream can help with cellulite, but the results arenât great. Twice-daily application of a 0.3% retinol cream for 6 months can thicken your skin and reduce that orange-peel look. Cellulite Treatments to Use With Caution or Avoid Injectables Some doctors inject chemicals into the fat layer below the skin to encourage breakdown and make cellulite less noticeable.

Additional Resources What is the best treatment for cellulite? Cellulite affects up to 85% of adult women and can be extremely difficult to correct. Many treatments are ineffective or take multiple sessions to complete with very temporary results. \"Orange peel skin\" or \"cottage cheese\" affects all body shapes and sizes, from the slim to the full-figured. It is common to confuse the concept of cellulite with that of normal fat and assume that cellulite is a direct response to overeating or lack of exercise. However, this is not the case. Normal fat and cellulite respond very differently to diet and/or exercise. When you diet, your body automatically burns its own reserves of stored fat. But cellulite is fat that is trapped in the dermal layer of skin and the body cannot effectively process it as fuel, so it remains. Given the perplexing nature of cellulite, how can it be treated? Fortunately, there are a number of options available. Topical creams contain retinol or caffeine that can increase blood flow to the affected area, thus temporarily reducing the appearance of cellulite. Rollers (like Endermologie) can similarly reduce swelling and inflammation in the affected tissues and temporarily reduce the appearance of cellulite. Radiofrequency devices (e.g., BTL Vanquish, Thermi) can reduce the connective tissue in the affected area and increase blood flow to reduce the appearance of cellulite. However, each of these approaches is limited by the fact that the results are reversible and may only last weeks, days, or even hours. Similarly, they can only address relatively minor areas. For more significant dimpling and for permanent results, patients require more intensive treatment.

The Public's Concerns and How ... Concerns generally focus on how the GMO may affect the environment or how it may affect the consumer. One specific concern is the possibility for GMOs to negatively affect human health. This could result from differences in nutritional content, allergic response, or undesired side effects such as toxicity, organ damage, or gene transfer. To address these concerns, there have been over 100 research studies comparing the effects of traditional food to genetically modified food, the results of which have been reviewed in various journals [1], [2]. How these results affect regulation can be found through The Center for Environmental Risk Assessment, which hosts a GM Crop Database that can be searched by the public to find GMO crop history, style of modification, and regulation across the world [3]. Though knowing who to trust and what to believe regarding this topic is an ongoing battle, major health groups, including the American Medical Association and World Health Organization, have concluded from the research of independent groups worldwide that genetically modified foods are safe for consumers [4]. Regarding toxicity, this includes any dangers related to organ health, mutations, pregnancy and offspring, and potential for transfer of genes to the consumer. GMO toxicity: fears and scientific analysis After genetically modified foods were introduced in the United States a few decades ago, people independently reported toxic effects caused by GMOs. One example is an anti-GMO advocacy group called the Institute for Responsible Technology (IRT), which reported that rats fed a diet containing a GMO potato had virtually every organ system adversely affected after just ten days of feeding [5]. The IRT stated that the toxicity was the result of genetic modification techniques and not a specific case for that particular potato. They claimed the process of making the GMO caused it to be toxic and thus all GMOs were high risk for toxicity.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d2", "source_url": "https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/gmo-pros-and-cons", "snippet": "GMOs: Pros and Cons, Backed by Evidence GMOs: Pros and Cons, Backed by Evidence Although most notable organizations and research suggest that GMO foods are safe and sustainable, some people claim they may harm your health and the environment. GMOs, short for genetically modified organisms, are subject to a lot of controversy. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), GMO seeds are used to plant over 90% of all maize (corn), cotton, and soy grown in the United States, which means that many of the foods you eat likely contain GMOs (1). This article helps explain what GMOs are, provides a balanced explanation of their pros and cons, and gives guidance on how to identify GMO foods. “GMO,” which stands for genetically modified organism, refers to any organism whose DNA has been modified using genetic engineering technology. In the food industry, GMO crops have had genes added to them for various reasons, such as improving their growth, nutritional content, sustainability, pest resistance, and ease of farming (2). While it’s possible to naturally give foods desirable traits through selective breeding, this process takes many generations. Also, breeders may struggle to determine which genetic change has led to a new trait. Genetic modification significantly accelerates this process by using scientific techniques that give the plant the specific desired trait. For example, one of the most common GMO crops is Bt corn, which is genetically modified to produce the insecticide Bt toxin. By making this toxin, the corn is able to resist pests, reducing the need for pesticides (3). GMO crops are incredibly common in the United States, with at least 90% of soy, cotton, and corn being grown through genetic techniques (4). While GMO crops make farming much easier, there is some concern around their potential effect on the environment and their safety for human consumption — specifically surrounding illnesses and allergies (5). However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and USDA maintain that GMOs are safe for human and animal consumption (6).", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d3", "source_url": "https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324576", "snippet": "Pros and cons of GMO foods: Health and environment Some people have also raised fears that eating GMO food could lead to genetic changes in humans. However, most of the DNA in food — whether GMO or not — either is destroyed by cooking or breaks down before it reaches the large intestine. Small fragments of DNA from food can and do enter the bloodstream and body organs, but there is no evidence that they have any impact on genetic makeup or human health. Toxicity for body organs In 2009, some researchers suggested that GMO foods might impact the liver, kidney, pancreas, and reproductive system. They did not have evidence to confirm this and called for further studies. The use of GMO crops may even reduce the risk of toxicity from some substances, as farmers can avoid using pesticides that have been harmful in the past. In the U.S., the FDA does not require special labeling for GMO foods. This is because they must meet the same safety standards as other foods, and there should be no need for additional regulation. However, a GMO food needs a special label if it is “materially different” from its conventional counterpart. For example: a GMO canola oil with more lauric acid than traditional canola oil will be labeled “laurate canola oil” a GMO soybean oil with more oleic acid than non-GMO soybean oil must be labeled “high oleic soybean oil” a GMO soybean oil with a high level of stearidonic acid, which does not naturally occur in the oil, must be labeled “stearidonate soybean oil” However, the 2018 National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard states that all foods containing genetically engineered ingredients must now carry the label “derived from bioengineering” or “bioengineered.” Specific symbols show whether a food has been bioengineered.

Unfortunately, the zealous proponents of health foods have gone beyond advocacy of ingredients the medical establishment deems “healthy.” Foods whose heritage can be traced to intentional genetic modification in a modern laboratory are ominously labeled as “genetically modified organisms” (GMOs). Although this label has taken on a negative connotation, it’s simply a descriptor and, by itself, cannot convey whether or not a product is “healthy.” Such labeling is like singling out children born using modern in vitro fertilization and treating them differently than children conceived “naturally”! Conflating the nutritional composition of food with its genetic heritage allows marketers to extract a premium for foods labeled “non-GMO” while failing to acknowledge the actual health benefits of some GMOs. In 2016, Congress established the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard (NBFDS), a US federal law that mandates “BE” labeling for bioengineered foods. These foods contain genetic material not accessible via breeding, added using in vitro recombinant DNA techniques. This law empowers USDA to specify whether ingredients should be labeled BE depending on their supply chains and to define analytical tests that establish whether labeling is necessary. These analytical tests allow the agency to define bioengineered products precisely. While GMO and BE foods may overlap, the two labels are inconsistent and have different criteria specified by different organizations. Science has weighed in on GMO/BE foods, and numerous studies have shown no health risks associated with the consumption of GMO/BE foods.2 Indeed, bioengineering improves the nutritional content of some foods. For example, low linoleic acid canola oil has less trans-fat, a dietary component associated with increased rates of heart disease. In such cases, the nutritional differences are reflected on food labels following FDA guidelines.

While many of us are familiar with the term GMO, not all of us are quite sure what it is—only, perhaps, that we are advised to avoid them by some people. A 2018 consumer survey by the IFIC found that more than one-third (36 percent) of respondents said they know very little or nothing at all about bioengineered or genetically modified foods, identical to the number who say they know at least a fair amount. Despite the low level of knowledge, a higher volume of respondents (47 percent) said they avoid GMO foods at least somewhat. But when we hear or read “GMO” or “bioengineered food,” do we ever think of the terms “safety,” “regulation” or “sustainability”? If not, IFIC is here to tell you that we should.

Honey is sweet and mild, so parents and caregivers may think it’s a good choice as a spread on toast or a natural way to sweeten other items. However, experts recommend waiting until after your baby’s first birthday to introduce honey into their diet. This includes mass-produced honey, raw and unpasteurized honey, and local honey. This food rule also applies to all foods and baked goods containing honey. Read on to learn more about introducing honey to your baby, including risks, benefits, and how to introduce it. Risks The primary risk of introducing honey too soon is infant botulism. Babies under 6 months of age are at the highest risk. While this condition is rare, most of the cases reported are diagnosed in the United States. A baby can get botulism by eating Clostridium botulinum spores found in soil, honey, and honey products. These spores turn into bacteria in the bowels and produce harmful neurotoxins in the body. Botulism is a serious condition. Some 70 percent of babies who get botulism may require mechanical ventilation for an average of 23 days. The average hospital stay for botulism is around 44 days. There may be many small improvements followed by setbacks. Most babies recover with treatment. The fatality rate is less than 2 percent. Other liquid sweeteners, like molasses and corn syrup, may also carry a risk for botulism. Maple syrup is generally considered safe because it comes from inside a tree and cannot be contaminated by soil. Still, some doctors do not recommend giving babies sweeteners until after their first birthday. It’s best to check with your pediatrician before offering sweeteners as part of your child’s diet.

When you mix honey with water, an enzyme in honey called glucose oxidase produces hydrogen peroxide. The production of hydrogen peroxide is the primary reason for its antimicrobial activity. Research from Dr. Peter C. Molan of the University of Waikato in New Zealand showed that certain types of honey help prevent cavities because of their antimicrobial potency. You can even place honey directly on the site of inflammation or infection in the mouth. Honey’s antibacterial properties flush out harmful bacteria. By fighting the bacteria, honey reduces the amount of acid your mouth produces. Without that acid, bacteria can no longer produce dextran, which is essentially the “glue” that helps bacteria attach to the tooth surface. Bacteria become plaque, which eventually can harden into what leads to gum disease and tooth decay. Identifying a Dentist Office You Can Trust Choosing your dentist is a big decision. This guide help you make the right choice. Wait! It Matters Which Honey You Use The question is honey bad for your teeth isn’t quite a simple yes or no. Before you start buying barrels of honey, know that research warns that all honey is NOT made equal. The majority of honey sold in the US is processed or refined. Like any processed food, it can contribute to health issues. Therefore, for the most benefit, learn how to distinguish health-saving honey from the potentially health-damaging. Tip 1: Stay away from honey that says ‘ultra-filtered’. When honey is ultra-filtered, it is impossible to know the origin of the pollen, making it easier for the manufacturer to tamper with the honey. Honey can be smuggled into the US illegally, preventing consumers from knowing what it contains.

The success of Mānuka honey in attacking gut bacteria is due to the potent bacteria-fighting and anti-inflammatory properties of MGO. Treats Acne and Other Skin Diseases A growing body of evidence shows that Mānuka honey can be applied to improve skin health. One study found Mānuka honey as an effective form of fighting eczema, with lesions significantly improved post-Mānuka honey use. Raw honey balances the bacteria on your skin, making it an effective product in treating acne. Plus, honey is also a natural exfoliator, which means applying it to your face can potentially remove the dry skin and reveal the new skin cells underneath. What’s more, Mānuka honey can make scars less visible. Since Mānuka honey is rich in hydrogen peroxide and methylglyoxal, it can help lighten hyperpigmentation and scars. Studies show that the bacteria-fighting properties of MGO in Mānuka honey can inhibit the growth of harmful oral bacteria. Specifically, research has shown that Mānuka honey can stifle the growth of harmful oral bacteria like P. gingivalis.

Raw Honey Is Full Of Sweet Surprises! Raw honey is one of nature’s most interesting and diverse products. Whether you’re adding it to tea or using it to help manage seasonal allergies, raw honey is packed with nutrients, antioxidants and more. Here are our top five reasons for keeping it stocked in your pantry. Antioxidant-Rich: Honey is packed with antioxidants that help protect your body from free radicals. Free radicals negatively affect the aging process and may play a role in contributing to chronic diseases like cancer and heart disease. Nature’s Antibiotic: For thousands of years, honey has been used to heal wounds, treat fungal infections and kill harmful bacteria. It’s a natural antiseptic because it contains hydrogen peroxide. Prebiotic: Prebiotics are compounds found in food that help nourish good bacteria in the gut. They’re critical to maintaining a healthy digestive system and honey is a natural prebiotic. Honey has also been proven to help with certain stomach ulcers and treat diarrhea. Treats The Common Cold: Honey helps soothe sore throats and is a natural cough suppressant proven to be as effective as many over-the-counter medications. Add it to hot tea or take a couple of teaspoons straight to alleviate symptoms. Allergy Treatment: Scientific studies have not proven that honey helps alleviate symptoms, but anecdotal accounts from hundreds of years indicate that raw local honey is an effective treatment to treat seasonal allergies. What Are The Negatives? Honey can become contaminated with a specific type of bacteria found in soil and dust that is harmful to babies with undeveloped digestive systems. That’s why medical practitioners say that honey should not be given to a baby less than one-year-old. That same bacteria will not harm older children and adults because their digestive systems have matured.

Raw honey is honey that has not been pasteurized or finely filtered. We coarse filter our honey to remove large debris, but do not fine filter our honey. Since heating honey can destroy enzymes and nutrients, raw honey contains more of these beneficial components. Pro-biotic bacteria can also be found in raw, unfiltered honey; these good bacteria can colonize the intestinal tract and protect the body from invasion by harmful bacteria. Certain beneficial antioxidants are also present in higher levels in raw, unfiltered honey than in processed honey. Raw and unfiltered honey might crystallize; this does not impair the taste or quality of the honey, only its appearance and consistency. If you prefer a liquid consistency, gentle heating in hot water and stirring can eliminate any crystals. Gallberry Honey The Gallberry bush is found mainly in the slash pine forests and swamps of South Georgia and parts of North Florida, giving Gallberry honey a “uniquely southern” taste. Gallberry honey is admired for its unique, mildly tangy flavor. Gallberry honey is also desirable for its medicinal properties and it can serve as a substitute for sugar in recipes. Orange Blossom Honey Orange Blossom honey is the product of a partnership between beekeepers and orange growers. The growers want the highest possible production in their groves, whereas the beekeepers want an early spring crop to build up strong hives for the upcoming pollination season.

Honey eliminates harmful bacteria while promoting beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria. As a result, honey is a natural way to nurture a healthy gut biome. Antioxidant Honey’s antioxidant effect is two-fold. First, honey contains antioxidant components such as phenolic acids and flavonoids. Other components of honey include carotenes, organic acids, and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), all of which contribute to honey’s antioxidant effects. Second, honey promotes antioxidant activity. One study tested the blood of ten participants before and after regular honey consumption. Over the course of two weeks, antioxidant agents in the blood had increased notably. Beta-carotene, vitamin C, and glutathione reductase levels, among others, showed a remarkable increase. Anti-inflammatory Honey has recently received attention for its anti-inflammatory properties. Honey reduces inflammation by suppressing pro-inflammatory agents such as inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Significantly, honey can target tissue-specific and general inflammation. A study showed that honey may be helpful in reducing edema, as it successfully suppressed the expression of NF-κB in rats with paw edema. Targeted tissues benefit from honey’s supportive immune role as an anti-inflammatory. Unprocessed honey can also stimulate anti-inflammatory agents such as prostaglandin E2. Honey can even reduce the severity of chronic inflammatory diseases. Treatment and Prevention Honey’s medicinal value has made it a subject of focus for treatments and prevention.

What was claimed Our verdict While some vaccines contain substances that may be neurotoxic in high amounts, many also occur naturally and the levels in vaccines are too low to cause any harm. A Facebook post misleadingly suggests that vaccinating young children involves injecting them with neurotoxins. The post contains an old image of a cynical-looking Justin Timberlake and a caption which reads: “When you're told not to give your baby honey under the age of 1, but are encouraged to inject them with known neurotoxins instead.” We have assumed this second part is a reference to childhood vaccines, or possibly to vitamin K. Is honey bad for babies? It is true that both the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the NHS recommend that parents not feed honey to infants under 12 months old. The NHS says this is because: “Occasionally, honey contains bacteria that can produce toxins in a baby's intestines, leading to infant botulism, which is a very serious illness.” Infant botulism is extremely rare. According to a 2018 report by Public Health England, there have been only 19 cases between 1978 and January 2018. Not all the cases were linked to the consumption of honey. However, it is misleading to suggest that other injections routinely given to young children are more harmful than honey. All vaccines undergo extensive safetytesting before being authorised for use. Although some vaccines contain substances such as formaldehyde or aluminium, high exposure to which has been associated with damage to the nervous system, the levels present in vaccines are extremely low compared to the amounts that naturally occur within the body and therefore do not pose any additional risk.

It is made by extracting honey from the honeycombs and then pouring it over a mesh to separate out the impurities, such as beeswax and dead bees. Once strained, raw honey is bottled and ready to be enjoyed. Honey that lasts and lasts (until it’s gone) Because of the different compounds it contains, namely a specific enzyme found in the stomach of the bees which suppresses the growth of harmful bacteria, honey can last almost indefinitely, as long as its exposure to humidity is limited. Health benefits of raw honey Most of the health benefits of honey can be attributed to its antioxidants and enzymes. Unprocessed, raw honey contains nearly 30 types of bioactive plant compounds. These polyphenols act as healing antioxidants and have been linked to impressive health benefits, including reduced inflammation and a lower risk of heart disease and certain cancers. The processing of honey A lot of the honey available today is processed. Processed honey is quite different from raw honey due to the filtering it goes through, stripping it of many of its natural health benefits. Pasteurisation, a process of applying high heat, makes honey smoother and more liquid. It also destroys the yeast found in honey by. Filtration, which takes out air bubbles and other bits so the honey stays as a clear liquid for longer and is more aesthetically appealing to many consumers, further removes many beneficial nutrients like pollen, propolis, enzymes and antioxidants. Essentially, raw honey is more nutritious than ultra-filtered, processed, pasteurised honey. It is extracted from the beehive, strained and poured straight into the jar, bypassing commercial processing methods, which can also include the adding sugar or sweeteners by some unscrupulous honey manufacturers.

Cough Relief for Children Health authorities do not recommend over-the-counter medications to treat young childrenâs coughs and colds. Some parents may look for natural remedies. In one study, two teaspoons of honey relieved childrenâs nighttime cough and allowed them to sleep. However, doctors do not recommend this practice for children less than a year old. Potential Risks of Honey Honey is a safe food for most people, but not for all. Here are some potential risks of eating honey, including raw honey: Botulism in Infants You should not give honey to infants under 12 months. Honey contains dust particles that may carry spores of the bacteria that causes botulism. Infants lack resistance to many germs, and they could get very sick. Using honey in cooking food for children should be safe, as heat destroys most bacteria. Allergies Those who are prone to allergies should be careful about eating honey. Although honey allergies are rare, they do occur. Perhaps this is due to bee pollen in the honey. Bee pollen is a mixture of pollen and digestive enzymes from bees. It can trigger a serious allergic reaction. Some people say that eating local honey improves their seasonal allergies. They believe the pollen in the honey desensitizes them to pollen in the air. There is not enough evidence to support this. It could be harmful to rely on honey rather than seeking medical treatment for respiratory allergies.

To take full advantage of these properties, it is best to apply honey topically to the area of concern. In fact, veterinarians will sometimes use honey as part of a wound dressing for specific injuries. It can help to keep the wound clean and promote healing when it cannot be closed right away with stitches. Â Immunity-Boosting Properties Studies in mice have shown that honey may increase the production of antibodies and help to produce a stronger immune response. There is limited evidence to confirm whether or not this happens in dogs, and how much of an overall effect it might have on a dogâs immune system. There would be little harm in giving it to otherwise healthy adult dogs; however, it could be unsafe to give it to dogs who are already immunocompromised. Â Antioxidant Properties Honey is a good source of antioxidants, including Vitamin C, flavonoids, and polyphenolics, which can help to protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. These effects have been measured when honey is given by mouth. Honey that is darker in color is likely to have more antioxidants. Digestive Health Benefits Honey may help to improve digestive health by reducing inflammation, preventing certain infections from taking hold, and promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. Â Skin Health Benefits Because of the antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties of honey, it may help to soothe certain allergic and inflammatory skin conditions.

There’s just one sweet that the smaller and younger members of that crowd are strictly advised to never consume: honey. The World Health Organization is just one of many medical groups worldwide that agree that honey should not be fed to infants under 12 months of age, whether added to their formula, used to soothe teething, or employed to sweeten foods. But why shouldn’t babies eat honey? The problem with feeding honey to babies stems from their developing microbiome—the array of microorganisms, such as bacteria and archaea, that live inside and on humans and that assist in the regulation of diet and affect many bodily functions. Before babies reach the age of one year, the bacteria in their gut is not developed enough to stop certain harmful bacteria from infecting the body. Clostridium botulinum is a potentially poisonous bacterium that, in addition to causing the illness known as infant botulism, is often found in raw and processed honey. According to a study published in 1998, up to 25% of honey products have been found to contain spores of that bacterium. Symptoms of infant botulism can be scary. They include a weakening of the muscles, causing a child to appear limp and unable to move arms or legs, and potential respiratory failure.

Read on to learn about eight unexpected sources of food poisoning that everyone should be aware of. Honey Packed with antioxidants and antibacterial properties, honey has also been known to soothe a sore throat and ease digestive issues. The beneficial sweetener, however, has some risks associated with it. Because it doesn't go through a pasteurization process, raw honey can contain spores of Clostridium botulinum, a bacterium that is especially harmful to babies, children, and pregnant women. It can cause botulism poisoning, a rare poisoning that may result in life-threatening paralysis. Rice Can leftover rice give you food poisoning? Unfortunately, yes. The problem is that uncooked rice may contain spores of Bacillus cereus, a bacterium that can cause food poisoning. These spores can survive even when the rice is cooked, and if you leave it out at room temperature, the spores can grow into bacteria and multiply, producing toxins that cause food poisoning. Get any leftover rice in the fridge within an hour of preparation so bacteria have little opportunity to grow. Rotisserie chicken Although rotisserie chicken makes a convenient, high-protein meal, it can also make you sick. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), bacteria in food can multiply rapidly when it's left in the \"danger zone,\" an environment between 40- and 140 degrees Fahrenheit.

Ballon d'Or The Ballon d'Or (French pronunciation:[balɔ̃dɔʁ]ⓘ; lit.'Golden Ball') is an annual football award presented by French magazine France Football since 1956 to honour the player deemed to have performed the best over the previous season. Conceived by sports writers Gabriel Hanot and Jacques Ferran, the Ballon d'Or was based exclusively on voting by football journalists up until 2006. Originally, it was awarded only to players from Europe and was widely known as the European Footballer of the Year award. In 1995, the Ballon d'Or was expanded to include all players of any origin that have been active at European clubs. The award became a global prize in 2007 with all professional footballers from around the world being eligible; additionally, coaches and captains of national teams were also given the right to vote, before reverting to just journalists in 2016. Between 2010 and 2015, in an agreement with FIFA, the award was temporarily merged with the FIFA World Player of the Year, and was known as the FIFA Ballon d'Or. That partnership ended in 2016, and the award reverted to the Ballon d'Or, while FIFA also reverted to its own separate annual award, The Best FIFA Men's Player. In 2022, France Football modified the rules for the Ballon d'Or. The timing was changed so that awards were given not for achievements during a calendar year, but for a football season, and it was also determined that an international jury of specialized journalists, with one representative per country, from the top 100 in the latest FIFA Men's World Ranking would elect the winner of the award.

Awarded jointly by FIFA and France Football, the prize was a merger of the FIFA World Player of the Year award and the Ballon d'Or, the two most prestigious individual honours in world football. Unlike the Ballon d'Or awarded by France Football, the FIFA Ballon d'Or, was not awarded solely based on votes from international journalists, but votes from national team coaches and captains also, who selected the players they deemed to have performed the best in the previous calendar year. Messi, who played for Barcelona, won the inaugural Ballon d'Or in 2010 and went on to win three in a row, after his wins in 2011 and 2012.

The FIFA World Player of the Year award was presented by FIFA, the sport's governing body, from 1991.[3] From 2005, the winners of the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award were identical each year. Following the introduction of a global Ballon d'Or format in 2007, France Football and FIFA opted to merge the two awards.

No, we’re not talking about a sitcom. We’re talking about the current trending diet of intermittent fasting. But before you dismiss it as just a fad, Jeffrey Hooper, MD, says for some people intermittent fasting has real benefits that may go beyond weight loss. “It’s not new,” says Dr. Hooper, medical director for the MultiCare Center for Weight Loss & Wellness. “Like so many things in weight loss, the pendulum swings, and intermittent fasting is getting popular again.” And because it’s been around for a while, intermittent fasting “actually has science behind it,” he adds. In late December, the New England Journal of Medicine published an article reviewing previous intermittent fasting studies, giving the method another big publicity boost. The review highlighted findings that, along with promoting weight loss, intermittent fasting decreases insulin resistance and the chances of developing diabetes, reduces risk for some cancers and forms of dementia and increases cardiovascular health and stress resistance. Studies in rats showed that intermittent fasting greatly increased their lifespans and slowed the aging process. “A lot of these things are connected to weight loss, but others are less related,” Dr. Hooper says. “There’s benefit from doing this that goes beyond just the weight loss effect.” Researchers know it works, but not necessarily how, he says. The New England Journal review theorizes that the key is something called “metabolic switching.” The body always needs energy, and when you’ve eaten, that energy comes from the glucose in your food. But when you haven’t eaten for a few hours, your body turns to glucose stored in your liver. When you still don’t eat, your body runs out of its stored glucose, then turns to burning ketones from your fat cells. This process is also the basis for the ketogenic diet, Dr. Hooper says. The difference between intermittent fasting and a strict keto diet is that you don’t have to restrict any foods.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d2", "source_url": "https://www.dzne.de/en/news/press-releases/press/intermittent-fasting-not-an-anti-aging-remedy-for-mice/", "snippet": "Intermittent fasting: not an anti-aging remedy for mice - DZNE Intermittent fasting: not an anti-aging remedy for mice Bonn/Munich (Germany), July, 31st, 2017. Fasting affects the body in a number of ways. Abundant evidence is available to show that it can even extend the lifespan of animals. But does fasting slow down the aging process? At least in mice, anti-aging effects are limited. This is the conclusion of a joint study by the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) and the Helmholtz Zentrum München. However, the regular alternation of periods of food intake and fasting – a dietary regimen called “intermittent fasting” – slowed down the development of life-limiting cancers. As a result, the animals lived longer than mice with free access to food. There is no doubt that fasting affects the body and the mind. While little research has been done into the long-term effects on humans, many studies have examined the consequences of life-long fasting in animals. These experiments have shown that mice placed on a strict diet live longer than controls with free access to food. Average lifespan is extended by around 15 percent in mice. In human terms, this would mean around 12 additional years of life. But do these animals age more slowly? “Until now, this was the prevailing view within the scientific community. It is often based on the observation that fasting animals live longer than controls without restrictions in feeding. However, measuring only lifespan does not provide conclusive evidence regarding possible effects on aging. An extension in lifespan can be the result of an isolated effect on specific life-limiting diseases,” says Dr. Dan Ehninger, who leads a research group at the DZNE’s site in Bonn. “We therefore looked comprehensively at a large range of features associated with aging. Overall, we found only limited evidence for a retardation of aging as a consequence of fasting.”", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d3", "source_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4755412/", "snippet": "Dietary restriction with and without caloric restriction for healthy aging Caloric restriction and fasting share similar but often distinct effects on a number of biomarkers (e.g. reduced glucose, and insulin levels) suggesting that partially overlapping mechanisms are involved 19.

Macronutrient restriction In addition to periodic or intermittent fasting-based strategies as alternatives to caloric restriction, the restriction of specific macronutrients (or macronutrient restriction) without the restriction of calories is among the most promising interventions that have emerged to promote healthy aging in humans. Among the different types of macronutrient restriction, reduced intake of proteins and amino acids is the most effective pro-longevity intervention 35, 36. Simply reducing protein intake can deliver an equally potent impact on lifespan as dietary restriction in multiple model organisms 35. A recent analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) showed that low protein intake was associated with reduced overall mortality for those under 65 years of age 37. Also, a high-carbohydrate, low-protein diet resulted in longer lifespan and improved cardiometabolic health, despite increased food intake and body fat 38, 39. Furthermore, the restriction of a single essential amino acid in a normal diet increased lifespan and stress resistance 40– 44. In flies, adding back essential amino acids to the caloric restriction diet decreased lifespan to that of the normally fed group 36. Laboratory rodents fed a methionine-restricted diet displayed an extended lifespan with decreased age-dependent diseases and increased resistance to oxidative stress, in part due to increased antioxidant capacity 44– 48.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d4", "source_url": "https://www.news-medical.net/news/20221214/Study-reveals-limited-effects-of-longevity-treatments-on-the-aging-process.aspx", "snippet": "Study reveals limited effects of longevity treatments on the aging ...

Researchers in Germany have found that three popular anti-aging strategies fail to actually slow the hands of time. During their review, a team from the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) developed a new way to measure aging. Instead of simply looking at lifespan, the team focused on the age-related changes that take place in a wide range of bodily functions over time. Using this measure, they examined the effectiveness of intermittent fasting and two anti-aging treatments which target cell metabolism and growth hormones, respectively. Results show that each longevity strategy was largely ineffective when it comes to slowing the aging process. “There is no internal clock of aging that you can regulate with a simple switch – at least not in the form of the treatments studied here,” says Dr. Dan Ehninger of the DZNE, the initiator of the study, in a media release. “We chose three regulators for our interventions that many experts believe slow down aging,” explains Prof. Dr. Martin Hrabě de Angelis, head of the Institute of Experimental Genetics and director of the German Mouse Clinic at Helmholtz Munich.

However, most people practicing IF concentrate primarily not on what but on when they eat. Scientists believe that the eating period in intermittent fasting is equally important as the fasting period. During these two periods, cells are affected positively and activated towards rejuvenation and prevention of aging-related diseases. During IF your body starts using the stored fat and energy thus contributing to weight loss. Practiced along with daily exercise, IF may help to lose weight faster. IF contributes to DNA repair by breaking down free radicals causing oxidative stress. During the fasting period brain activity increases, memory and sleep quality improve. This way, IF hinders neurodegenerative disorders while aging. Yet, intermittent fasting may not be a suitable reverse aging diet plan for everyone. Dietitians advise not to practice IF to the people falling into these groups Pregnant and breastfeeding women People younger than 18-year-olds People with confirmed health disorders such as diabetes People with a previous history of eating disorders Hence, intermittent fasting is a natural method for reverse aging and is one of the effective reverse aging habitspracticed by thousands of people with documented health benefits for slow aging. 2.

When food wasn’t available, their metabolisms would also slow down, keeping the weight on as long as it could (6). With middle age, your metabolism slows down due to hormonal changes, so simply cutting calories rarely will result in weight loss. Your metabolism slows down even further because it thinks it’s in a famine. And it’s not just about the quantity of the food you’re eating but the quality. While younger premenopausal women have to adapt their fasting due to their cycling schedule, you’ll have the advantage of consistency. Menopausal women can stick with their fasting schedule and should be able to last longer without worry. Intermittent fasting isn’t about not eating but about eating less often. You don’t have to worry about how many calories you’re eating during your feeding window when you’re eating quality foods. Your body is designed to fast intermittently, so start taking advantage of your ancestor’s adaptation to lose the stubborn weight. 🔔 Best Intermittent Fasting For Women Over 50 The 16/8 method of intermittent fasting is the simplest to do and one of the most effective long-term for getting results. This fasting schedule allows you to have dinner at night and then lunch the next day. Skipping breakfast is the easiest meal to drop since most are busy in the mornings. Women in their 50s can practice intermittent fasting more often and for longer periods than younger women since they do not have to worry about adjusting it for their monthly cycle. In addition, you can use intermittent fasting daily if your goal is to lose weight and its additional health benefits.

By early 1895, Tesla was ready to transmit a signal 50 miles to West Point, New York... But in that same year, disaster struck. A building fire consumed Tesla's lab, destroying his work. The timing could not have been worse. In England, a young Italian experimenter named Guglielmo Marconi had been hard at work building a device for wireless telegraphy. The young Marconi had taken out the first wireless telegraphy patent in England in 1896. His device had only a two-circuit system, which some said could not transmit \"across a pond.\" Later Marconi set up long-distance demonstrations, using a Tesla oscillator to transmit the signals across the English Channel. Tesla filed his own basic radio patent applications in 1897. They were granted in 1900. Marconi's first patent application in America, filed on November 10, 1900, was turned down. Marconi's revised applications over the next three years were repeatedly rejected because of the priority of Tesla and other inventors. The Patent Office made the following comment in 1903: Many of the claims are not patentable over Tesla patent numbers 645,576 and 649,621, of record, the amendment to overcome said references as well as Marconi's pretended ignorance of the nature of a \"Tesla oscillator\" being little short of absurd... the term \"Tesla oscillator\" has become a household word on both continents [Europe and North America].

Nikola Tesla was born in the Serbian part of Croatia in 1856. Last year was his 150th birthday. He began inventing as a boy. Tesla was educated in various European universities in mechanical and electrical engineering, physics, and languages. During the late 1800s, he worked for Thomas Edison’s European telephone company in Budapest and Paris. He immigrated to the US in 1884. He worked for Edison in New York City for a while, but pursued inventions on his own with great success.

This essay responds to “Misreading the Supreme Court: A Puzzling Chapter in the History of Radio” by A. David Wunsch in the November 1998 issue of Antenna. As regular readers of this newsletter know, on June 21, 1943, the Supreme Court affirmed a 1935 ruling of the United States Court of Claims which essentially invalidated Marconi’s claim of having invented radio, and clarified Tesla’s role in inventing radio. The granting of a patent in itself does not help to establish priority of invention. Unlike an infringement action, in a patent grant application no one but the examiner goes out of his way to dig up facts that provide a basis for the rejection of the patent. The patent examiner tries to do this, but is limited to papers on file in the patent office or available to him without great effort or expense. The applicant’s attorney is supposed to bring to the examiner’s attention all the adverse information he runs across, but he doesn’t waste his client’s money trying to find data which will help the examiner find grounds to deny the patent. The radio litigation discussed here arose in the Court of Claims, in a claim for taking intellectual property that was basically the same as an infringement action. Marconi filed a claim against the U. S. government for taking four patents. The patents were: reissue no. 11,913 of patent no. 586,193, granted to Marconi on June 4, 1901, for a two-circuit system for transmitting and receiving signals (one circuit in the transmitter; another in the receiver); patent no.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d4", "source_url": "https://www.edn.com/tesla-gives-1st-public-demonstration-of-radio-march-1-1893/", "snippet": "Tesla gives 1st public demonstration of radio, March 1, 1893 - EDN Tesla gives 1st public demonstration of radio, March 1, 1893 Nikola Tesla gave the first public demonstration of radio in St. Louis on March 1, 1893, although he had presented his work prior to this behind closed doors. Tesla first demonstrated wireless transmissions during a lecture in 1891. Just days before the St. Louis presentation, Tesla addressed the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, on February 23, 1893, describing in detail the principles of early radio communication. Tesla presented the fundamentals of radio in 1893 during his public presentation, “On Light and Other High Frequency Phenomena.” Afterward, the principle of radio communication–sending signals through space to receivers–was widely publicized from Tesla’s experiments and demonstrations. Even before the development of the vacuum tube, Tesla’s descriptions contained all the elements that were later incorporated into radio systems. He initially experimented with magnetic receivers, unlike the coherers (detecting devices consisting of tubes filled with iron filings which had been invented by Temistocle Calzecchi-Onesti in 1884) used by Guglielmo Marconi and other early experimenters. Radio offers another example of Tesla’s work receiving minimal or no long-term public acknowledgement.

The event made the front page of the New York Times as the first transatlantic wireless message from an American president to a European head of state. Although the station was dismantled about eighty years ago, its site, now within the Cape Cod National Seashore, is marked by a nearby National Park Service information center. Available there is a Park Service leaflet that tells visitors that the inventor Nikola Tesla “proposed the essential elements of radio communication in 1892 and 1893” prior to Marconi, and that “the U.S. Supreme Court in 1943 decided that Marconi’s basic patents were ‘anticipated’ and therefore were invalid.”1 The Supreme Court case referred to is Marconi Wireless Telegraph Corporation of America v. United States, 320 US 1 (1943), which was argued in April and decided on June 21, 1943. References to this case are not uncommon and repeat the Court’s finding that Tesla, not Marconi, invented the first radio. For example, writing in the New York Times of August 28, 1984, science reporter William Broad noted that: “It was Nikola Tesla, not Marconi, who invented radio.2 Indeed in 1943 the Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States overturned Marconi’s patent because they found it had been preceded by Tesla’s practical achievements in radio transmission.”3 Tesla’s priority over Marconi in the invention of radio is not the only conclusion often drawn from that court case.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d6", "source_url": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/plaque-nikola-tesla-radio-wave-building", "snippet": "Plaque of Nikola Tesla on Radio Wave Building – New York, New ... Nikola Tesla is the real father of radio. Although Tesla was granted the first radio patent in 1900 and made headlines for his radio wave technologies even in the late 19th century, Italian Guglielmo Marconi has gone down in history as the medium’s inventor. That said, not everyone – or everywhere – has forgotten about Tesla’s contributions to the creation of radio. In 1977, the appropriately-named Radio Wave Building in Lower Manhattan began displaying a plaque thanking Tesla for his work in the field of radio technology. Tesla, who lived in the building in its former incarnation as the Gerlach Hotel in 1896, experimented with radio waves there. The plaque notes Tesla’s advancements in the “field of alternating electric current.” For the science-uninitiated, the building’s name gives sufficient credit where credit is long overdue. The story of how Tesla lost his patent, however, is unbelievable in itself. Marconi was originally discounted by the U.S. Patent Office as coattail-rider trying to pull a fast one on their office. In 1903, in response to Marconi’s radio patent application, they said, “Many of the claims are not patentable over Tesla patent numbers 645,576 and 649,621, of record.” Marconi proclaimed his ignorance of the Tesla oscillator, an invention so famous that the Patent Office knew it was impossible another scientist wouldn’t know of it. Despite the disapproval of his patent, Marconi’s Wireless Telegraph Company, Ltd. began gaining popularity in England, where he lived, and abroad. Perhaps because of his good looks, charm and connections within British society, stock in the company began increasing in price and soon after Marconi famously became the first person to transmit radio signals across the Atlantic Ocean.

Radio History often touts Italian entrepreneur Guglielmo Marconi as the inventor of radio. But sometimes history is wrong. Marconi is credited with sending the first transatlantic radio transmission, using technology from 17 of Tesla’s patents. The two inventors became embroiled in a patent war. In fact, the United States Supreme Court revoked Marconi’s radio patents in 1943 in favor of Tesla and two other scientists, Oliver Lodge and John Stone.

Tesla invented one of the world’s earliest remote controls, which he called a “teleautomaton.” He patented his device in 1898 as a “Method of and Apparatus for Controlling the Mechanism of Moving Vessels or Vehicles,” which he used it to control a miniature boat from afar during a demonstration at Madison Square Garden. According to the Tesla Museum in Belgrade, Tesla knew how important the invention could be, so he patented it in 11 countries as well. X-ray technology Tesla was also a pioneer of X-ray technology.

Without a coherer on the receiving end, radio would have never gotten off the ground. Marconi was very successful in assembling a system for wireless telegraphy. Although he was born in Italy, Marconi spent a great deal of his life in England. It was there that he got the patent and formed the British wireless service. He later formed the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company. Then in 1901, Marconi demonstrated trans-Atlantic wireless by sending the letter S (dot-dot-dot) from his station in Poldhu, Cornwall to Signal Hill in St. John's, Newfoundland. Marconi went on to become very successful (and rich) selling early wireless services and products and gathering royalties from his patents. The Weird Genius Thought Of It First The real inventor of radio in now considered to be Nikola Tesla. Tesla was born in Croatia, educated in Europe, and eventually immigrated to the US in 1884. Tesla was a genius. He invented so much stuff that it is hard to catalog all of it (much less understand it). This process is still going on today, as Tesla's claims of \"death rays\" and the transmission of electrical power wirelessly are still being examined. One of his earliest successes was the invention of the AC induction motor. He also helped George Westinghouse defeat Thomas Edison in the battle of AC vs. DC in the electrical power distribution war of the late 1800's. AC eventually won simply because you could step AC up with a transformer and transmit it over long distances then step it back down. This was a more efficient and economic way to transmit power than Edison's DC system, which required many more generation stations close to the customers. Tesla also worked on the first big AC generating plant at Niagara Falls. In any case, Tesla got the idea for radio back in 1892 and demonstrated a remotely controlled boat in 1898.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d9", "source_url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/story/who-really-invented-the-light-bulb-and-other-myths-debunked/mwWRW_mbN0mdJQ?hl=en", "snippet": "Who Really Invented The Light Bulb?

Yet most historians agree that it was actually Dutch spectacle maker Hans Lippershay who had been making magnification devices using the improved quality of glassmaking of the time. Supposedly, Galileo had heard about these and decided to build his own, making some improvements in the process. One of the reasons why Galileo was credited with inventing the telescope is because he was the first person to use these new optics as a scientific instrument, which is where the real value was added. There’s a lot of controversy and intrigue surrounding the invention of the telephone.

In fact, independently of Guglielmo Marconi, Tesla did develop a device that enabled wireless communication in 1896 which he patented in 1897. This discovery would eventually win Marconi the Nobel Prize. Tesla's own patents were later revoked by the U.S. Patent office which sparked a legal battle between the two until well into the 1940s. But, both of their work was predated by a Russian physicist, Alexander Popov. He successfully demonstrated a working radio receiver a year before Marconi and Tesla, in 1895. But, all of their work, including Popov, would not have been possible without the works of many scientists before them. It should be noted that Tesla can rightfully be called the inventor of Radio Control (RC) with his 1898 demonstration in Madison Square Gardens. 7. Some claim that Tesla invented Radar But the truth is not so clear cut - in fact you might say it's a 'can of worms.' Radar, in and of itself, would not exist without the groundbreaking work of German physicist Heinrich Hertz. He demonstrated the existence of electromagnetic waves (including radio) in the late 1880s, thus validating the theories of James Clerk Maxwell from the 1860s.

He soon developed an electrical lamp that gave off an intense \"radiant energy.\" His invention allowed for the production of more powerful X-rays, which made it possible for doctors and scientists to get detailed images of internal organs and anatomy. As a result, physicians could diagnose and treat diseases much better than ever before. 4. Radio In spite of Guglielmo Marconiâs popular claim of inventing the radio, it was, in fact, Nikola Tesla who had first demonstrated a functioning version in 1893. Tesla patented this invention in 1897 and presented it to the public during a demonstration at his New York laboratory. This invention revolutionized communication, paving the way for television, mobile phones and todayâs wireless internet. Tesla went on to dedicate himself to developing remote control - a device working on similar principles as his radio inventions. The first two vessels that were guided by signals sent by remote control were launched simultaneously across two bodies of water - one boat at Madison Square Garden using terrestrial rays, and another boat in Uxbridge using invisible rays from wireless technology. 5. Remote control Although later developed during the two world wars, this is one of many revolutionary inventions made by Nikola Tesla. He demonstrated a radio-controlled boat that could move in any direction. Even if today it might seem obvious, 100 years ago the idea to control the movements of any object by remote control was considered magic. 6.

Of course, you know about Tesla’s involvement with AC electricity, as he designed AC motors, generators, transformers and power transmission devices, which together used 25 of the most valuable patents since the telephone. All 25 of which Tesla created, and are still used today. However, Tesla also invented the first hydro-electrical plant powerful enough to provide light for an entire city. This plant was put in Niagara Falls, and a few statues of the man have since been placed there in his honor. Another invention of his was radio, and wireless transmission. And by radio, I mean he discovered ways to transmit radio waves, not… the radio, as in the device we use in cars to listen to music. While many assume Guglielmo Marconi was the inventor of radio, the truth is that Marconi’s work was heavily based on Tesla’s. In fact, Tesla demonstrated a radio controlled boat in 1898 (basically a remote control toy boat) roughly 3 years before Marconi would take the credit for radios invention. To be clear, Marconi was the first person to transmit what was essentially a wireless message across the Atlantic, which is how he got the invention credited to him, but he did not invent radio.

Between 1878, when the amendment was first introduced in Congress, and August 18, 1920, when it was ratified, champions of voting rights for women worked tirelessly, but strategies for achieving their goal varied. Some pursued a strategy of passing suffrage acts in each state—nine western states adopted woman suffrage legislation by 1912. Others challenged male-only voting laws in the courts. Some suffragists used more confrontational tactics such as picketing, silent vigils, and hunger strikes. Often supporters met fierce resistance. Opponents heckled, jailed, and sometimes physically abused them. By 1916, almost all of the major suffrage organizations were united behind the goal of a constitutional amendment. When New York adopted woman suffrage in 1917 and President Wilson changed his position to support an amendment in 1918, the political balance began to shift. On May 21, 1919, the House of Representatives passed the amendment, and 2 weeks later, the Senate followed. When Tennessee became the 36th state to ratify the amendment on August 18, 1920, the amendment passed its final hurdle of obtaining the agreement of three-fourths of the states.

Dutch women won the passive vote (allowed to run for parliament) after a revision of the Dutch Constitution in 1917 and the active vote (electing representatives) in 1919, and American women on August 26, 1920, with the passage of the 19th Amendment (the Voting Rights Act of 1965 secured voting rights for racial minorities). Irish women won the same voting rights as men in the Irish Free State constitution, 1922. In 1928, British women won suffrage on the same terms as men, that is, for ages 21 and older. The suffrage of Turkish women was introduced in 1930 for local elections and in 1934 for national elections. By the time French women were granted the suffrage in July 1944 by Charles de Gaulle's government in exile, by a vote of 51 for, 16 against,[43] France had been for about a decade the only Western country that did not at least allow women's suffrage at municipal elections.[44] Voting rights for women were introduced into international law by the United Nations' Human Rights Commission, whose elected chair was Eleanor Roosevelt. In 1948 the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; Article 21 stated: \"(1) Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives. (3) The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures. \" 21st century One of the most recent jurisdictions to acknowledge women's full right to vote was Bhutan in 2008 (its first national elections).[45]", "timestamp": "2024-12-27"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "source_url": "https://www.rockthevote.org/explainers/the-19th-amendment/", "snippet": "The 19th Amendment - Rock the Vote The 19th Amendment makes it illegal to deny the right to vote to any citizen based on their sex, which effectively granted women the right to vote. The largest women’s organization at the time, The Women’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), established in 1873, joined the general suffrage movement giving the effort an enormous boost. At the local level, suffragists made several attempts to vote and after being turned away filed lawsuits hoping to bring the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court. Susan B. Anthony successfully voted in 1872 but was later arrested and found guilty for voting in a highly publicized trial that helped fuel the movement. In 1875, in Minor v. Happersett, the Supreme Court upheld states’ rights to deny women the right to vote recognizing the plaintiff as a citizen but stating that the constitutionally protected privileges of being a citizen did not include the right to vote. Tensions between prominent leaders, including Douglass and Stanton faded and in 1890, the NWSA and the AWSA merged to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). This new organization’s mission was to lobby women’s voting rights on a state-by-state basis. Women’s Suffrage in the States It’s worth noting that New Jersey recognized women’s right to vote in 1797; however, women were stripped of their voting rights in 1807 when the state passed allowing only free white males the right to vote. In the six-years following the formation of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) in 1890, Colorado and newly formed states of Wyoming, Utah, and Idaho adopted amendments to their state constitution granting women the right to vote. At the start of the 20th century, there was a renewed momentum to the women’s suffrage movement with more states extending voting rights to women, including 22 states prior to 1920. Following a January 1917 meeting with President Woodrow Wilson, the NWP launched what became a two and a half year protest outside the White House involving a total of more than 2,000 women who picketed and went on hunger strikes.", "timestamp": "2022-08-22"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "source_url": "https://www.tam.usace.army.mil/Portals/77/Women%27s%20Equality%20DAY%20Timeline.pdf", "snippet": "[PDF] Women's Right to Vote, a Timeline of obtaining Equality Although the Fifteenth.

Women's suffrage, the legal right of women to vote, was established nationally in the United States with the passage of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in August 1920. While a landmark moment in history, it would be several decades before all women, particularly women of color, were able to exercise their voting rights. In 1924, the Snyder Act granted Native Americans citizenship rights, including the right to vote. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 sought to overcome legal barriers at the state and local levels that prevented racial minorities, especially Black voters in the South, from exercising their right to vote as guaranteed under the 15th and 19th Amendments to the Constitution. The 1975 extension of the Voting Rights Act ended discrimination against \"language minorities,\" including those who speak Asian, American Indian, Alaska Native, and Spanish languages, by requiring certain jurisdictions to provide translation materials for voter registration information and ballots. Prior to the passage of 19th Amendment, women had the right to vote to in various elections in a number of states and localities. More details available at the National Constitution Center.

The war ends in 1763 with the Treaty of Paris, greatly expanding Britain’s empire in North America. 1756 Lydia Chapin Taft votes in Uxbridge, Massachusetts. 1765 Sir William Blackstone publishes Commentaries on the Laws of England, reinforcing the tradition of “coverture” — that once married, a woman’s property belongs to her husband and she has no legal rights. “Coverture” was brought over by the British colonists who followed the traditions of English Common Law. 1765 The Stamp Act is passed by the British Parliament, placing a direct tax on newspapers, playing cards, and pamphlets. Some colonists view this as unfair taxation without representation and formed organizations called the Sons and Daughters of Liberty. These groups begin to organize boycotts of British goods.

Much of the movement's energy, however, went toward working for suffrage on a state-by-state basis. These efforts included pursuing officeholding rights separately in an effort to bolster their argument in favor of voting rights.[3] In 1916, Alice Paul formed the National Woman's Party (NWP), a group focused on the passage of a national suffrage amendment. Over 200 NWP supporters, the Silent Sentinels, were arrested in 1917 while picketing the White House, some of whom went on hunger strike and endured forced feeding after being sent to prison. Under the leadership of Carrie Chapman Catt, the two-million-member NAWSA also made a national suffrage amendment its top priority. After a hard-fought series of votes in the U.S. Congress and in state legislatures, the Nineteenth Amendment became part of the U.S. Constitution on August 18, 1920.[18] It states, \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. \" National history Background Most of the early U.S. states, continuing in their pre-Revolutionary War traditions as British colonies, adopted constitutions that expressly denied women the right to vote. The basis for this practice was rooted in traditional societal views and legal doctrines. During the Middle Ages, the English common law adopted the doctrine of coverture, which held that a married woman was a \"feme covert\" with no legal personhood of her own and who was legally considered indistinct from her husband.

Only the second president in the nation’s history to personally appear before the Senate, Wilson was on a political mission. The nation is at war, he reminded lawmakers. “This war could not have been fought…[without] the services of…women.” He implored senators to pass the constitutional amendment providing for women’s suffrage. Since the Susan B. Anthony Amendment was first introduced in 1878, women had aggressively lobbied Congress to approve it. In 1913 hundreds of activists descended upon Washington. “We want action now,” they chanted as they marched into the Capitol. By 1916 both party platforms supported women’s suffrage. That year, Wilson won reelection, and Democrats gained control of the House and Senate. At the beginning of the new Congress in 1917, senators insisted that “if the president wants [the amendment] to pass…[we will] vote for it.” The president thought the issue should be left to the states, however, so suffragists focused their efforts on winning over Wilson. They silently picketed the White House, banners in hand, for months on end. When the United States entered World War I in April 1917, critics denounced the ongoing protests as unpatriotic. “Suffrage must be put aside,” they insisted. “This is war.” Rather than retreat, suffragists doubled down, hoisting new banners that addressed the president as “Kaiser Wilson.” Washington, D.C., police arrested protestors en masse. In prison, suffragists endured beatings and violent force-feedings. When journalists reported news of their inhumane treatment, Wilson felt compelled to respond. The president worried that Congress’s failure to pass the amendment had become a political liability for his party. His concern prompted him to personally deliver a speech to the Senate, five weeks before the midterm election of 1918. “Give justice to women,” he pleaded.", "timestamp": "2023-09-08"}, {"doc_id": "d10", "source_url": "https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/10/05/key-facts-about-womens-suffrage-around-the-world-a-century-after-u-s-ratified-19th-amendment/", "snippet": "Key facts about women's suffrage around the world At least 20 nations preceded the U.S. in granting women the right to vote, according to an analysis of measures in 198 countries and ...

(Brooks Kraft LLC/Sygma via Getty Images) This year marks the centennial of the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees women the right to vote. But the United States was hardly the first country to codify women’s suffrage, and barriers to vote persisted for some groups of U.S. women for decades. At least 20 nations preceded the U.S., according to a Pew Research Center analysis of women’s enfranchisement measures in 198 countries and self-administering territories. Today, none of these 198 countries and territories bar women from voting because of their sex; some countries do not hold national elections. Here is a closer look at the history of women’s suffrage around the world. This analysis focuses on when women in each country won the right to vote in national elections, not regional or local elections. How we did this A century after U.S. women gained the right to vote, we conducted this analysis to find out when women in other countries were first enfranchised at the national level. The analysis is based on information about 198 countries and self-administering territories from government publications, historical documents from organizations like the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and news reports. For each country or territory, the year in which women received the right is based on the date this right was codified in a law or constitution or officially granted as part of a United Nations plebiscite. The analysis looks only at when women gained the right to vote in national elections, not in regional or local elections. In some cases, data about when these measures were passed is incomplete, contradicted in other publications or difficult to find, so this analysis is as complete and accurate as possible within our research limitations.

Even the closest known exoplanet to Earth, Proxima Centauri b, is still about 4 light-years away. We know there are more planets than stars in the galaxy. By measuring exoplanets’ sizes (diameters) and masses (weights), we can see compositions ranging from rocky (like Earth and Venus) to gas-rich (like Jupiter and Saturn). Some planets may be dominated by water or ice, while others are dominated by iron or carbon.

A. H. Walker, and Stephenson Yang of the University of Victoria and the University of British Columbia.[59] Although they were cautious about claiming a planetary detection, their radial-velocity observations suggested that a planet orbits the star Gamma Cephei. Partly because the observations were at the very limits of instrumental capabilities at the time, astronomers remained skeptical for several years about this and other similar observations. It was thought some of the apparent planets might instead have been brown dwarfs, objects intermediate in mass between planets and stars. In 1990, additional observations were published that supported the existence of the planet orbiting Gamma Cephei,[60] but subsequent work in 1992 again raised serious doubts.[61] Finally, in 2003, improved techniques allowed the planet's existence to be confirmed.[62] On 9 January 1992, radio astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail announced the discovery of two planets orbiting the pulsarPSR 1257+12.[45] This discovery was confirmed, and is generally considered to be the first definitive detection of exoplanets. Follow-up observations solidified these results, and confirmation of a third planet in 1994 revived the topic in the popular press.[63] These pulsar planets are thought to have formed from the unusual remnants of the supernova that produced the pulsar, in a second round of planet formation, or else to be the remaining rocky cores of gas giants that somehow survived the supernova and then decayed into their current orbits. As pulsars are aggressive stars, it was considered unlikely at the time that a planet may be able to be formed in their orbit.[64]", "timestamp": "2024-12-27"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "source_url": "https://spaceexplored.com/how-many-exoplanets-are-there-discovered/", "snippet": "How many exoplanets have been discovered? - Space Explored NASA estimates that there are over 100 billion exoplanets in our galaxy. Here's how many have been found and which are Earth-like. How many exoplanets have been discovered? NASA estimates that the Milky Way Galaxy is home to at least 100 billion planets. Others believe it could be anywhere from 200-300 billion. Using data from exoplanet-hunting missions such as Kepler, Gaia, and now James Webb, we can identify and confirm their existence. So, how many exoplanets have been discovered? These are the number of confirmed exoplanets and planetary systems by NASA, followed by the number of exoplanet candidates, which are discoveries that could be planets but are still unconfirmed by researchers. What is an exoplanet? An exoplanet is any planet orbiting a star outside of our solar system. Exoplanets can come in many different sizes and compositions. NASA categorizes the 5,241 confirmed exoplanets into 5 subtypes: Neptune-like, Super Earth, Gas Giant, Terrestrial, and the unknowns. Here’s how the space agency describes each: Neptune-like (1,919) These planets are Neptunian worlds, similar to Uranus or Neptune in our solar system. Super Earth (1,689) Super-Earths are exotic planets unlike any in our solar system–more massive than Earth yet lighter than gas giants like Neptune, and they can be made of gas, rock, or a combination of both. Gas Giant (1,786) These planets belong to a class known as gas giants, similar to Jupiter or Saturn in our solar system. How do we find them? Currently, there are 5 different methods scientists use to identify exoplanets. These include measuring tiny changes in a star’s brightness to looking for wobbling stars, usually caused by orbiting planets.

Today, the exoplanet count is more than 5000. Here's what we've learned. Did the other stars in the Universe have planets orbiting them? If so, what percent of them had planets? How many did they have? And were the planets like ours, or were they vastly different? Just thirty years ago, humanity was beginning to uncover the answers, as we started to discover planets in orbit around stars other than our own. At last, through a combination of multiple different methods ⁠— the radial velocity method, timing measurements, the transit method, and gravitational microlensing ⁠— we’ve surpassed 5000 known exoplanets: planets located beyond our own Solar System. As is often the case, these discoveries have been tremendous and have answered some of our deepest questions about the cosmos. Nevertheless, even deeper ones now remain. Here’s what we’ve learned so far. What do planets outside our solar system, or exoplanets, look like? A variety of possibilities are shown in this illustration. Scientists discovered the first exoplanets in the 1990s. As of 2024, the tally stands at over 5,000 confirmed exoplanets. None are known to be inhabited, but a few raise tantalizing possibilities: largely among the Earth-sized planets, but not so much among the larger ones. What is an exoplanet? In the early 1990s, two different methods, at almost the same time, started to reveal planets that were located beyond our own Solar System. Through measuring the periodic pulses coming from a neutron star, we could see that the pulses would regularly speed up, then return to normal speed, then slow down, and then return to normal speed again, over and over. The fact that these pulses changed with the same period and amplitude told us that there were massive companions in these pulsar systems, and by measuring the pulse timing, we could infer the masses of these companions: they were definitively planets. Similarly, we could observe the periodic redshifting and blueshifting of the light from individual stars, which also revealed the presence of massive planets, which “tugged”", "timestamp": "2022-03-24"}, {"doc_id": "d7", "source_url": "https://science.nasa.gov/resource/video-nasa-confirms-5000-exoplanets-and-counting/", "snippet": "Video: NASA Confirms 5000 Exoplanets - and Counting There are billions of exoplanets in our galaxy alone, so many ... have now confirmed more than 5,000 exoplanets – planets beyond our solar system.

Exoplanets, worlds beyond the Solar System Highlights Scientists have discovered more than 5,000 planets outside of the Solar System, or âexoplanetsâ. Most stars in our galaxy have at least one exoplanet,Â and many are unlike any of the worlds in the Solar System. Some exoplanets could be habitable and are prime targets in the search for life beyond Earth. What are exoplanets? An exoplanet, short for âextrasolar planet,â is any planet that isnât in the Solar System. Some are gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, some are rocky like Mercury or Mars, and others are icy like Neptune or Uranus. A select fraction â weâre not quite sure how many â could be like Earth, rocky and with liquid water on their surfaces. There are also many exoplanets that donât look like anything we have in the Solar System. One of the most common kinds of planets are âsuper-Earthsâ and âmini-Neptunesâ, so called because they are larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. No world like this exists around the Sun. There are also planets, called âfree-floatingâ or ârogue planets,â that originally formed around a star but then got thrown out to drift through space alone. There are planets that orbit their host stars in hours, and there are planets that take millennia to go around once. There may be âwater worldsâ completely covered in oceans. And there are planetary systems, like TRAPPIST-1, where several planets are all packed into very close orbits around their star. Why study exoplanets? Are we alone? How did we get here? Every new exoplanet discovery provides important context to help answer these age-old questions.

The existence of idioms is a natural consequence of languages’ dynamism. Dialect differences are usually limited to intonation, pronunciation, isolated words and expressions, and grammar rules. Even though dialects are socially valued differently, Parisian French, for example, is perceived as more standard than Marseillais. Linguistically speaking, all dialects are equally valid. We need to remember that everyone speaks a dialect. Therefore, dialects are NOT incorrect or less authentic versions of a language. Study French Study French in Montréal and interact -as you should- with locals. You will learn the particularities of that area. French is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, and due to its extensive reach, there are several distinct French variants, including the vernacular and local language, accents, creoles, and dialects. 1. French Varieties & Accents in France French is the only official language of France. However, many tongues are native to its lands. These languages are often referred to as patois (a regional form of communication, i.e., dialects, mainly French), but the term usually has negative connotations. Alsatian is a form of Swiss German, Auvergnat is related to Catalan, Breton is Celtic, and Basque is a distinct language isolate. Occitan is similar to Catalan, whereas Corsican is close to Tuscan-based Italian. Besides, French Flemish is also technically a German/Flemish dialect, and Lorraine Franconian is another dialect of West Central German. All these languages are also referred to as mixed or altogether different tongues. The northern dialects (shown mainly in yellow and green on the map), which include Standard French, are known collectively as Langues d’oïl, a group of dialects that belongs to the Gallo-Romance. The Occitan dialects are a part of the Romance family of languages.

At the beginning of the 21st century, French was ... French has verb forms for indicative, imperative, and subjunctive moods; preterite, imperfect, present, future, and conditional, and a variety of perfect and progressive tenses; and passive and reflexive constructions. Linguistic change was more rapid and more drastic in northern France than it was in other European Romance regions, and influence from Latin was comparatively slight (though borrowing of Latin vocabulary has been great since the 14th century). The influence of the Germanic Frankish invaders is often held to account for exotic features in Old French, such as strong stress accent and abundant use of diphthongs and nasal vowels, but by the 15th century the language had begun to change, and a sober (even monotonous) intonation and loss of a stress accent became characteristic. The popularity of French as a first foreign language, in spite of numerous pronunciation difficulties for nearly all foreign speakers, is perhaps as much the result of the precise codification of its grammar, effectuated especially during the 18th century, as of the brilliance of its literature at all periods. Modern dialects are classified mainly on a geographic basis, and most survive only in rural areas. Walloon, spoken mainly in Belgium, is something of an exception in that it has had a flourishing dialect literature since approximately 1600. Other dialects are grouped as follows: Canadian French Outside France, the French of Canada, originally probably of northwestern dialect type, has developed the most individual features. Although 18th-century Canadian French was regarded as exceptionally “pure” by metropolitan commentators, it began to diverge from Parisian French after 1760 as a consequence of its isolation from the metropolis and of the ever-stronger influence of English. Canadian French is less clearly articulated, with less lip movement and with a more monotonous intonation, than standard French; some change in consonantal sounds occurs (/t/ and /d/ shift to /ts/ and /dz/, respectively, and both k and g become palatalized [pronounced with the tongue touching the hard palate, or roof of the mouth] when followed by the letters i or e);", "timestamp": "2024-12-13"}, {"doc_id": "d6", "source_url": "https://fluencycorp.com/french-dialects/", "snippet": "French Dialects French is a language that's spoken in various countries, which has led to the existence of different French dialects. French dialect from Québec is called Québécois, though people that aren’t from Canada also know it as Canadian French. The Québécois dialect has more vowel sounds, more specifically 15, that the French spoken in France. This leads to them having more diphthongs. This makes some words sound very differently than those of other types of French. As expected, the French spoken in Québec also has a lot of influence from the English language. This means they have many words that come from English. For example: “joke” or “canceler” that comes from “cancel”. This is highly important for you to remember, as some vocabulary can change when you’re speaking Québécois. If you want to have a Québécois accent, we recommend you open your mouth more.

Metropolitan French This is also known as the Standard French, which means it’s the one you most likely learned or will learn at school. So, if you’re planning on learning this type of French, you’ll probably have an easier time finding a school or teacher that teaches you this dialect. It’s also the type of French spoken in Paris, and other parts of France. That’s why it’s also known as Paris French. This gives you an advantage when you travel there. You’ll find many people that speak with this accent, so maybe you can practice it with them. After all, the more people speak a specific dialect, the more opportunities you have to practice. As it happens with many languages, Metropolitan French has changed through the years. People call the old type of Parisian French “le titi parisien”. But even though you can hear it in some old movies, nowadays it’s no longer used. It’s evolved to what we know now as Parisian or Metropolitan French. Now, what you must know about this accent is that many of the sounds of the words become short sounds. This is due to people speaking fast.

Constant wars led to the Kingdom of France losing a lot of its overseas territories in the 18th-19th Centuries, but the French language remained. During the 19th Century, France began to establish colonies throughout Africa.

Even since the rise of the Kingdom of France, the French language holds an essential role in the country’s politics and education. With such pillars, the francophone dialect that you hear in France is the standard version of French that most people refer to. French is spoken differently throughout the country, with specific regions and cities having their accents, tones, and quirks that they use to communicate. In France, the most standard type of the language is Parisian French, often called International French. As the capital of France, French spoken in Paris is based more closely on the official language rules as used in education and diplomacy. Parisian French is generally spoken faster than in other places and uses more connected words or pronunciations for a more fluid tone. As compared to a southern accent in the US, the south of France also has a peculiar accent for the local French. One of the most notable in the region is called Marseillaise French. French in this region is fast with a lot more pronounced syllables. French in Europe France isn’t the only place where they speak French in Europe. In fact, it’s the official language for two prominent countries - Switzerland and Belgium.

This variety, also known as Standard European French or Metropolitan French, is considered the prestige form of French used in ... (QF) is the predominant variety of French spoken in Canada. It's based on the French spoken in Paris during the 17th and 18th centuries. During that time, Europeans were colonizing the Americas, and French royals sent Parisians to live in la Nouvelle France (New France) which is modern-day Quebec. Once in Quebec, the Parisian French that had been brought over evolved differently from the French back in Paris because it was in contact with different Amerindian languages and English in the surrounding community. Pronunciation: The sounds “t” and “d” are pronounced as “ts” (sort of like the \"zz\" in English \"pizza\") and “dz” (like at the end of \"buds\" in English) when they’re in front of the letters “i\" and “u.” So, petit (little) gets pronounced as petsi and mardi (Tuesday) as mardzi. Grammar: Informal QF often uses -tu placed after the conjugated verb to mark questions that can be answered with \"yes\" or \"no,\" like T’as-tu fini ? (Have you finished?). Local slang: While traveling in Quebec, you’ll hear many words with localized meanings such as un chum (a friend or boyfriend), un char (a car), un dépanneur (a convenience store) and magasiner (to shop). Some of these words also exist in Standard European French with completely different meanings. For example, un char means \"a chariot\" in France and un dépanneur is \"a mechanic,\" which can sometimes create some comical misunderstandings across dialects!

Sportico’s first two rankings were based on 12-month earnings between June 2020 and May 2021 and then June 2021 to May 2022. The salary and prize money are inclusive of all bonuses paid during that time, including signings, incentives, playoffs and All-Star game pay. Bonuses from the PGA Tour’s Player Impact Program and Comcast Business Tour Top 10 are included in prize money, as are the proportional signing bonuses doled out by LIV Golf. Those contracts vary, but many of the top players received roughly half of their bonus payments when they signed their contracts and another portion when they teed it up at their first LIV event, according to multiple golf agents familiar with the contracts. The remaining signing bonus is paid out during the life of the contract. Most of the big names joined LIV in 2022, with Jon Rahm by far the biggest and most expensive “get” in 2023. Tyrrell Hatton was the one new LIV player in 2024 to make the top 100. In soccer and basketball, the listed salaries reflect weighted averages of base salaries during the 2023-24 and 2024-25 seasons, as well as bonuses paid out during 2024. The salaries listed are a blend of two seasons based on estimated payment schedules. The salary totals do not include deferred compensation until it is paid out.

Nevertheless, we used streaming numbers, chart success, social media, and the careers of other musicians in each season to determine which winner of \"The Voice\" has had the best career (and which ones could use a little boost). 26.

The film had its premiere at the 44th Telluride Film Festival on September 2, 2017, and was theatrically released in the United States by Fox Searchlight Pictures on September 22, 2017.[6] It received positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances of Stone and Carell and the direction, with some calling it the best performance of Stone's career. Despite the positive reviews, the picture performed poorly at the box office, grossing $18 million against a $25 million budget. While the women's tour struggles during its early days, Billie Jean King begins an affair with Marilyn Barnett, her hairdresser, threatening her marriage to Larry King. Meanwhile, men's pro-tennis player Bobby Riggs's marriage to the wealthy Priscilla Whelan is in trouble because of his addiction to gambling. Thrown out of his house when he can't conceal a Rolls-Royce he won in a tennis bet, he hits upon the idea of a challenge match against the top woman player, boasting that even at age 55 he can beat any woman. The women's tour has slowly gained a stronger foothold, with the Women's Tennis Association formed in 1973. Riggs continues to pressure King to play him. Eventually, Riggs persuades Margaret Court, who recently overtook King to gain the World No. 1 ranking, to play a match in May 1973. Riggs easily defeats Court and King decides she has to accept his challenge, but demands a final say as to the arrangements. King trains intensely, while Riggs relaxes. King objects to Kramer as a game announcer, threatening to not play unless he withdraws, which he does. After a slow start, King wins the match, changing the future of women's tennis. A textual epilogue states that King divorced her husband in the 1980s, retired from tennis in 1990, and later became involved in a long-term same-sex relationship while Riggs reunited with his wife but never quit his gambling habit.

Not much is known of Marilyn Barnett, the hairdresser who became such an important part of Billie Jean King’s life, and Andrea Riseborough was surprised at how little information had been documented. Nevertheless, Marilyn plays a key role in Battle of The Sexes because of the essential real-life role she played for Billie Jean King during her famous match against Bobby Riggs in 1973. Her character serves as a symbol of hope, freedom and empowerment as King stands up for her individuality, her sexuality, and her fight for the rationality of equal respect and equal pay. Riseborough tells me she enjoyed playing the role because Barnett was a captivating spirit and seems to symbolize so much of what the ’70s was about. The film also allowed Riseborough to be reunited with Emma Stone for the first time since the duo appeared together in Birdman.

As Billie Jean King’s lover, Andrea Riseborough wanted to embody the free spiritedness of the era “She’s just in a pressure cooker,” Andrea Riseborough says of Billie Jean King during the early ‘70s. As Marilyn Barnett, King’s lover in “Battle of the Sexes,” Riseborough wanted to be the hope for changing times. It isn’t necessarily reflective of the roles she’s played to date, but Andrea Riseborough says she’s always been “quite politicized.” In fact, CNN was running in the background blasting whatever breaking news was occurring on the hour during our mid-morning conversation a few weeks ago. That being said, the British actress didn’t expect a film she shot a year ago to be so politically relevant in today’s current political climate. In “Battle of the Sexes,” Riseborough plays Marilyn Barnett, the former hairdresser and, arguably, first love of legendary tennis player and social activist Billie Jean King (Emma Stone). Barnett was King’s first female lover and by her side during her infamous 1973 tennis match against Bobby Riggs (Steve Carell). While women around the world cheered on a King victory as a historic moment for gender equality, King was coming to terms with her feelings for Barnett. The events in the film took place over 40 years ago, but they resonate strongly today in what many are calling the “year of the woman.” “Billie Jean’s story is such an important one,” Riseborough says. “And I just kind of felt disbelief about not having really learned about any [of it as it was an] influential step in the right direction towards the legislation of equal pay.” Advertisement What captured my interest was that they so wanted to explore this love story between Billie Jean and Marilyn. — Andrea Riseborough After meeting with directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, she was immediately taken by how much compassion the filmmakers had for all the people involved.

Battle of the Sexes, though it frames the initial attraction between King and Barnett in a lovely way, doesn't fully engage with the insidious world in which the two women met. Battle of the Sexes paints King as a triumphant figure in athletics, but it doesn't fully explore how King's queerness was treated widely as perversion for years. While her true story doesn't negate what she did for women's tennis in 1973, it exposes how our culture pounded guilt and shame into an American icon for decades. The film does King's legacy a disservice by not taking those around her to task, and it has already been called into question for letting Bobby Riggs off the hook for his performative misogyny, putting the onus instead on promoter Jack Kramer (Bill Pullman). By telling a famous lesbian's story in soft focus, romanticizing her first connections with women and not taking to task the system that controlled her, Battle of the Sexes ignores some of the most difficult aspects of King's life. One recalls other historical biopics about queer figures in the media, The Imitation Game and The Danish Girl included, which integrate their subject's sexuality and gender identity into their portrayal while communicating the full scope of the distress they felt as they became self-actualized.

Critics Reviews Heather Hogan Autostraddle It's a sports movie, complete with breathless action sequences, overwrought crowd reactions, and a soaring score. It's a biopic about a legend. And it's one of the best lesbian films I've ever seen. Jul 2, 2018 Full Review Tara Brady Irish Times At 121 minutes, Battle of the Sexes occasionally drags, but it's the Hairy Legged Feminist-Male Chauvinist Pig showdown that we needed right now.

Conrad Hilton acquired management rights to the hotel on October 12, 1949, and the Hilton Hotels Corporation bought the hotel outright in 1972. It underwent a $150 million renovation ($466 million in 2023 dollars)[9] by Lee Jablin in the 1980s and early 1990s.

Both deals highlight the growing trend of Chinese investment into foreign property, particularly hotels. According to management firm JLL, Chinese investment into foreign commercial real estate increased by 46 percent to $11.2bn in 2014 from the previous year. Amid the current depreciation of the property market in China and the economy’s slowdown, real estate groups have begun to diversify their portfolios and invest further afield. In regards to the global hotel industry, other cities of choice for Chinese investment include San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle, as well as London, Paris and Sydney. The largest real estate group in China, the Dalian Wanda Group, has been a leader in this trend, with plans for multi-billion dollar investments in Chicago, Madrid and London.

And it's not the typical real-estate tycoon one would expect. In fact, it's the Chinese government. In a statement (in Chinese) released on February 23, China's Insurance Regulatory Commission detailed its reasons for taking over the property. What the report stated was that Anbang Insurance Group, a Beijing-based insurance, banking, and financial services firm and the owner of the hotel since 2014 (which recently tapped Skidmore, Owings & Merrill to renovate the landmark), is in danger of insolvency (in other words, the inability to pay its debts). What's more, Anbang chairman Wu Xiaohui is being being prosecuted on suspicion of committing white-collar crimes. China's quick takeover of Anbang's assets means that the government also controls several other high-profile American hotels, including the JW Marriott Essex House in Manhattan and the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington D.C., among others. The Waldorf Astoria is no stranger to change. A lesser-known fact about the historic hotel is that the original location was in the footprint currently occupied by the Empire State Building.

List of most-viewed YouTube videos YouTube is an American video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California. The site indicates view counts of each uploaded video, making it possible to keep track of the most viewed, many of which continue to exist while others are no longer available on the site. Although the most-viewed were initially viral videos uploaded by amateur content creators, such as \"Evolution of Dance\" and \"Charlie Bit My Finger\", they have increasingly become music videos produced on behalf of professional recording artists. Since Lady Gaga's \"Bad Romance\" in 2009, every video that has reached the top of the \"most-viewed YouTube videos\" list has been a music video. In November 2005, a Nike advertisement featuring Brazilian football player Ronaldinho became the first video to reach 1,000,000 views.[1] The billion-view mark was first passed by Gangnam Style in December 2012. On January 13, 2022, Pinkfong's \"Baby Shark\" became the first video to hit 10,000,000,000 views.[2] Views represent how many times a video is watched. To ensure that traffic is coming from actual humans and not scripts or other deceptive methods, YouTube has a secret algorithm to separate legitimate views from illegitimate ones, and only legitimate views are included in the view count.[3] Specifically, to count as a legitimate view, a user must intentionally initiate the playback of the video and play at least 30 seconds of the video (or the entire video for shorter videos). Additionally, while replays count as views, there is a limit of 4 or 5 views per IP address during a 24-hour period, after which point, no further views from that IP are counted until the 24-hour period expires.[4][5] Contents Top videos The following table lists the top 30 most-viewed videos on YouTube, with each total rounded to the nearest 10 million views, uploader, and publication date.", "timestamp": "2025-02-15"}, {"doc_id": "d2", "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLirAqAtl_h2r5g8xGajEwdXd3x1sZh8hC", "snippet": "Most Viewed Videos of All Time • (Over 700M views) - YouTube Most Viewed Videos of All Time • (Over 700M views) · Baby Shark Dance | #babyshark Most Viewed Video | Animal Songs | PINKFONG Songs for Children · Luis Fonsi - ...", "timestamp": "2012-10-17"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "source_url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/trending/top-10-listing/top-10-most-watched-videos-on-youtube-globally-as-of-2024-9644368/", "snippet": "Top 10 most-watched videos on YouTube globally as of 2024 Baby Shark Dance, a South Korean video poem, has become the highest-watched video on YouTube with 15.17 billion views.

The Japanese pilots were acting without authorization from the Japanese government. They were either opposed to the cease-fire or believed that Japanese airspace should remain inviolate until a formal surrender document was signed. They caused only minor damage and were held at bay by the B-32 gunners. The incident surprised US commanders, and prompted them to send additional reconnaissance flights. The following day, two B-32s on a reconnaissance mission over Tokyo were attacked by Japanese fighter aircraft out of Yokosuka Naval Airfield, with the pilots again acting on their own initiative, damaging one bomber. One of the bomber's crewmen was killed and two others wounded. It was the last aerial engagement of the war. The following day, as per the terms of the cease-fire agreement, the propellers were removed from all Japanese aircraft and further Allied reconnaissance flights over Japan went unchallenged.[163] MacArthur arrived in Tokyo on 30 August, and immediately decreed several laws: No Allied personnel were to assault Japanese people. No Allied personnel were to eat the scarce Japanese food. Flying the Hinomaru or \"Rising Sun\" flag was severely restricted.[164] The formal surrender occurred on 2 September 1945, around 9 a.m. Tokyo time, when Japanese representatives signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender in Tokyo Bay aboard USS Missouri, accompanied by around 250 other allied vessels, including British and Australian navy vessels and a Dutch hospital ship.[165] The surrender ceremony was carefully planned, detailing the seating positions of all Army, Navy, and Allied Representatives.[166] The ceremony was filmed in color by George F. Kosco, but the footage was released publicly only in 2010.[167] Each signatory sat before an ordinary mess deck table covered with green felt and signed two unconditional Instruments of Surrender—a leather-bound version for the Allied forces and a canvas-backed version for the Japanese.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d2", "source_url": "https://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/wars-conflicts-and-operations/world-war-ii/1945/victory-in-pacific.html", "snippet": "Japan's Surrender and Aftermath Finale: A Brief Chronology. The primary subsequent events, which ultimately led to the Japanese surrender on 14 August, unfolded as follows: General Douglas MacArthur, Southwest Pacific Area supreme commander, submitted a more specific plan—which included input from Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Jr., Pacific Ocean Areas commander in chief—on 28 May. The dual-phase Operation Downfall was to encompass an amphibious assault on the southwestern Home Island of Kyushu (Operation Olympic, November 1945), eventually followed by landings directly in the Tokyo–Kanto Plain area on Honshu (Operation Coronet, spring 1946). Although the latter operation was touted as a “knock-out blow” to Japan, planning assumptions explicitly did not exclude the possibility of fighting dragging into 1947. Moreover, Downfall would require redeployment of forces previously engaged in the European Theater. However, coupled with varying estimates of the large—even disastrous—numbers of expected Allied military and Japanese military and civilian casualties, indications of war weariness among the Allies made the defeat of Japan imperative within a twelve-month time frame. Finale: A Brief Chronology The primary subsequent events, which ultimately led to the Japanese surrender on 14 August, unfolded as follows: May–August: Continuing build-up of Japanese forces on Kyushu gradually exceeds Allied planning assumptions, leading to a reevaluation of the human costs associated with Operation Olympic and injecting uncertainty into the notional Operation Downfall timetable. 1 June: With the atomic bomb program nearly concluded, President Harry S. Truman’s program advisers, the Interim Committee, advise use of the bomb as soon as possible. Target lists have been drawn up since April. 22 June: Despite military mobilization of the Home Islands, candid assessments of Japan’s situation lead Emperor Hirohito to request that “concrete plans to end the war, unhampered by existing policy, be speedily studied and that efforts made to implement them.” Third-party intercession is raised with the Soviet Union, which merely strings along Japanese diplomats and provides no concrete response to their overtures.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d3", "source_url": "https://www.osti.gov/opennet/manhattan-project-history/Events/1945/surrender.htm", "snippet": "Manhattan Project: Japan Surrenders, August 10-15, 1945 - OSTI.GOV On August 10, 1945, Japan offered to surrender to the Allies, the only condition being that the emperor be allowed to remain the nominal head of state. . Next came the virtually simultaneous arrival of news of the Soviet declaration of war on Japan of August 8, 1945, and the atomic bombing of Nagasaki of the following day. Another Imperial Council was held the night of August 9-10, and this time the vote on surrender was a tie, 3-to-3. For the first time in a generation, the emperor (right) stepped forward from his normally ceremonial-only role and personally broke the tie, ordering Japan to surrender. On August 10, 1945, Japan offered to surrender to the Allies, the only condition being that the emperor be allowed to remain the nominal head of state. Planning for the use of additional nuclear weapons continued even as these deliberations were ongoing. On August 10, Leslie Groves reported to the War Department that the next bomb, another plutonium implosion weapon, would be \"ready for delivery on the first suitable weather after 17 or 18 August.\" Following the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, only two targets remained from the original list: Kokura Arsenal and the city of Niigata. Groves therefore requested that additional targets be added to the target list. His deputy, General Kenneth Nichols, suggested Tokyo. Truman, however, ordered an immediate halt to atomic attacks while surrender negotiations were ongoing. As the Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace recorded in his diary, Truman remarked that he did not like the idea of killing \"all those kids. \" On August 12, the United States announced that it would accept the Japanese surrender, making clear in its statement that the emperor could remain in a purely ceremonial capacity only.

Full Circle: The Japanese Surrender in Tokyo Bay, September 2, 1945 Every aspect of the Japanese surrender on board the USS Missouri was carefully choreographed, with one eye on the past and another on the future. September 2, 2020 The United States has always been particularly formal about how it accepts the surrender of defeated enemies. Each time it happens, the event is charged with deliberate—and sometimes inadvertent—symbolism. Such was the case on October 19, 1781, when General George Washington and his colleague, French General Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau, accepted the surrender of British General Charles Cornwallis’s British forces at Yorktown. The whole event was highly ritualized—although Cornwallis refused to appear, sending his subordinate Charles O’Hara out instead—with Rochambeau and Washington sternly directing O’Hara to tender his sword to American General Benjamin Lincoln, who had the previous year himself been forced to surrender to the British at Charleston, South Carolina. Likewise on April 9, 1865, when Confederate General Robert E. Lee and Union General Ulysses S. Grant met at Appomattox, Virginia. Although this surrender meeting was much more spur of the moment, it still was charged with symbolism that would last down through the ages. Victor and defeated unknowingly met in the home of farmer Wilmer McLean, who had fled there after having had the opening Battle of First Battle of Bull Run fought around his house on July 21, 1861. Both men conducted the surrender through a formal exchange of letters, with Grant’s concession that his former adversary officers could keep their swords, and the men their horses, standing out as an act of generosity.

No newsflash in modern history has ever been greeted with such overwhelming celebration. The iconic images of happy throngs holding up the newspapers that would go into countless scrapbooks and frames, the impromptu parades, hands in the air forming a “V” for victory, and the iconic images from Times-Square – including one very famous kiss between a nurse and a sailor.

The Spiel des Jahres (German:[ˈʃpiːldəsˈjaːʁəs], 'Game of the Year') is an award for board and card games, created in 1978 with the purpose of rewarding family-friendly game design, and promoting excellent games in the German market.[1] It is thought that the existence and popularity of the award was one of the major drivers of the quality of games coming out of Germany, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s.[2] A Spiel des Jahres nomination can increase the typical sales of a game from 500–3,000 copies to around 10,000, and the winner can usually expect to sell as many as 500,000 copies.[3] Award criteria The award is given by a jury of German-speaking board game critics from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland,[1] who review games released in Germany in the preceding twelve months. The games considered for the award are family-style games. War games, role-playing games, collectible card games, and other complicated, highly competitive, or hobbyist games are outside the scope of the award. Since 1989, there has been a separate award for children's games.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d3", "source_url": "https://boardgamegumbo.wordpress.com/2024/07/22/spiel-des-jahres-winners-2024/", "snippet": "Spiel des Jahres Winners 2024 - Board Game Gumbo Spiel des Jahres 2024 (family game of the year): SKY TEAM · Kennerspiel des Jahres 2024 (connoisseur's game of the year): DAYBREAK E-MISSION ...

I watched the live feed on YouTube this year, and the Jury had many of the actual designers and publishers represented at the awards. They even had an amusing German comic give a long spiel about her love of board games right before announcing the Spiel. Unfortunately, I did not get a chance to play all of the nominees, but that did not stop me from predicting the winners. How did I do? For Spiel, I have played Captain Flipand Sky Team many, many times. (I still have yet to play In the Footsteps of Darwin). Captain Flip just seemed like the perfect family weight game — easy to teach, one or two simple decisions each turn (do I flip? where do I place the tile?), addictive — and so while my heart was pulling for Captain Flip, I predicted Sky Team would win. For Kennerspiel, I also played two of the three — Guild of Merchant Explorers and TTR Legacy. My gut told me that Daybreak was going to win, but I picked The Guild of Merchant Explorers instead. Since I did not go to BGG Spring, I was not able to play or watch a play of any of the Kinderspiel games. Just based on what I read, I picked Große kleine Edelsteine by Wolfgang Warsch. But Magic Key was the winner. And so, I went only one of three on my predictions this year. I chalk it up to the fact that I was not able to play some of the winners.

In this game, the players are the pilot and co-pilot at the controls of an airliner working together as a team to land the airplane in different airports around the world. Cooperative games can operate in different ways, but this is a limited communication game that runs over a fixed number of turns as the plane descends. Before the descent, the pilot and copilot discuss the strategy. Once the players have agreed their plan, they are on their own until the end of the turn, throwing their own dice and carrying out their own actions. – Image by BGG contributor JuiceNeutron There has been some precedent for cooperative games over the years, with Hanabi, Paleo and last year’s winner Dorfromantic, receiving prizes as well as Pandemic Legacy: Season 2 which was given a special award. What makes Sky Team unusual as a Spiel des Jahres winner, however, is the fact is is a two player game. Although there have been a number of games that play particularly well with two (Scotland Yard or Lord of the Rings for example) and there has been a special awards for Seti (which is a two player game), this is the first time the Spiel des Jahres (or indeed the Kennerspiel des jahres) Award, traditionally a family prize, has gone to a two player game. In Daybreak, one to four players work together to battle climate change with each player controlling a World Power. If too many people from any World Power are in crisis, everyone loses, but if if by working together global emissions are reduced to net-zero, everyone wins. This concept has been used previously in a game, in particular CO2, but Daybreak is far more accessible. Daybreak also focuses on the the human cost of climate change and the benefits to humans that the solutions might bring, as such, as well as a good game in its own right, it also delivers an important message.", "timestamp": "2024-07-21"}, {"doc_id": "d6", "source_url": "https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/23798614/spiel-des-jahres-2023-dorfromantik-the-board-game", "snippet": "Dorfromantik: The Board Game wins the 2023 Spiel des Jahres award Germany's prestigious Spiel des Jahres award goes to Dorfromantik: The Board Game. by Oli Welsh.

This year’s Spiel des Jahres, a prestigious German award for the best board game of the year, has gone to a video game adaptation: Dorfromantik: The Board Game. Video game adaptations are common enough in tabletop gaming, and many of them are excellent, but the Spiel des Jahres award belongs at the traditional heart of the board game industry. Since its inception in 1978, it has remained focused on broadly accessible, family-friendly board games, as opposed to war games, role-playing games, collectible card games, and other more complex or hobbyist forms of tabletop gaming. Previous winners include canonical classics like Carcassonne and Ticket to Ride, so a video game adaptation winning the award is a big deal. But when you consider the game in question, perhaps it’s not so unexpected. Dorfromantik is a minimalist tile-placement game about building beautiful, pastoral landscapes of towns, rivers, forests, farms, and train tracks. Though it’s quite tightly designed, there are no competitive elements to it, and no resources or populations to worry about. It’s very much like Catan or, especially, Carcassonne, reimagined as a meditative single-player chillout game. And it’s absolutely wonderful. Dorfromantik: The Board Game, by Michael Palm and Lukas Zach, adapts the video game’s design while opening it up to as many as six players, although it remains a purely cooperative, non-competitive experience. The Spiel des Jahres jury chairman Harald Schrapers praised the game’s relaxed approach: “This cooperative, feelgood game has new, exciting goals from game to game, but you can never lose,” Schrapers said (via Google Translate). At time of writing, Dorfromantik: The Board Game is out of stock at Amazon, but you can find a copy at Cardhaus Games.", "timestamp": "2023-07-18"}, {"doc_id": "d7", "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/151d7w3/dorfromantik_has_won_spiel_des_jahres_2023/", "snippet": "Dorfromantik has won Spiel des Jahres 2023 : r/boardgames - Reddit Dorfromantik won, it ticks a lot of boxes of what the jury usually likes.

Friedberg, July 19, 2023: The Spiel des Jahres jury announced the annual winners for Kinderspiel (Children’s Game), Kennerspiel (Core Game) and Spiel des Jahres (Game of the Year) on Sunday evening. Dorfromantik – The Board Game by Lukas Zach and Michael Palm, published by Pegasus Spiele, won over the jury and has been awarded the title 2023 Game of the Year. Pegasus Spiele is proud to have celebrated eight awards from the Spiel des Jahres jury between 2012 and 2022, most recently for Living Forest, which won the Kennerspiel des Jahres 2022. In 2021, the jury awarded MicroMacro: Crime City (with partner Edition Spielwiese) the Spiel des Jahres and Dragomino the Kinderspiel des Jahres. For 2023, Pegasus Spiele has secured the illustrious Spiel des Jahres again with Dorfromantik – The Board Game. Dorfromantik, the 2021 video game by Toukana Interactive, delighted the gaming community with its cute villages, burbling rivers, rustling forests, and wheat fields swaying in the wind. This peaceful building game inspired the core design of Dorfromantik – The Board Game by Lukas Zach and Michael Palm, who delivered the experience to the tabletop in Autumn 2022. In this fully cooperative tile placement game, one to six players work together to create an idyllic countryside that fulfills the wishes of the townspeople. Each player in turn will draw and place a single hexagonal tile, and the group is encouraged to work together towards achieving their goals. Ideal tile placement will score points for all completed tasks, in addition to the longest railway, the longest stream, and large enclosed areas of landscape marked by flags.", "timestamp": "2023-07-19"}, {"doc_id": "d9", "source_url": "https://www.dicebreaker.com/topics/spiel-des-jahres/best-games/overlooked-spiel-des-jahres-winners", "snippet": "Best of the rest: 8 Spiel des Jahres winners you haven't heard of 5. Thurn und Taxis ... This is the most recent Spiel des Jahres winner on the list, having won in 2006, but it's been regrettably sidelined ... Best of the rest: 8 Spiel des Jahres winners you haven’t heard of The Spiel des Jahres is often seen as the biggest prize in board gaming. There’s a big fanfare over the nominees and winner every year that can translate into hundreds of thousands of extra copies sold. However, the 'Game of the Year' prize has far more humble roots, dating right back to 1979 when it was established to promote excellence in the German market for family-friendly games. From the outset it was made clear this was a critic's award, chosen by jury consensus rather than a popularity contest. Overlooked Spiel des Jahres winners Given the long history of the award and the refinement of player taste and design over that period, it’s unsurprising that most of the older Spiel des Jahres winners have fallen out of favour. But that doesn’t mean that it’s fair. While some of these titles feel clunky and underdeveloped to the modern gamer, others ought to be considered as minor classics or vital stepping stones on the pathway to the current hobby. Here are eight board game winners of the Spiel des Jahres, all of which can be picked up for bargain prices secondhand or played online, that deserve some modern-day love. 1.

This race game is still in print and with good reason; it still feels relatively fresh today, and so must have seemed an astonishing piece of innovation to that first jury back in the day. The concept is very simple: a race game without randomness where you pay carrot cards to move, the cost growing higher the further you choose to go. However, the course is full of wrinkles. You can’t land on spaces with other players, you have to land on at least three lettuce squares, while other spaces reward you with carrots based on their printed value and your race position.", "timestamp": "2023-07-10"}], "per_doc_notes": [{"doc_id": "d1", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "Dorfromantik: The Board Game won the Spiel des Jahres award in 2023, making it the most recent winner listed.", "quote": "2023, Dorfromantik: The Board Game · Michael Palm and Lukas Zach ; 2022, Cascadia · Randy Flynn ; 2021, MicroMacro: Crime City · Johannes Sich", "verdict_reason": "The snippet lists winners by year, showing Dorfromantik: The Board Game as the 2023 winner, directly identifying the most recent awardee.", "source_quality": "low"}, {"doc_id": "d2", "verdict": "partially supports", "key_fact": "The snippet mentions that Zauberberg (Magic Mountain) won the 2022 Spiel des Jahres award but does not confirm it is the most recent winner.", "quote": "2022 awards ; Zauberberg (Magic Mountain), Jens-Peter Schliemann and Bernhard Weber, Amigo, Won ;", "verdict_reason": "Provides a 2022 winner but does not state it is the latest, so only partial support for the most recent award query.", "source_quality": "high"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "Sky Team won the Spiel des Jahres 2024 award.", "quote": "Spiel des Jahres 2024 (family game of the year): SKY TEAM", "verdict_reason": "Explicitly names Sky Team as the 2024 Spiel des Jahres winner, directly answering which game won most recently.", "source_quality": "low"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "verdict": "partially supports", "key_fact": "The snippet refers to the 2024 Spiel des Jahres award winners but does not name the winning game.", "quote": "Award winners 2024 - Spiel des Jahres", "verdict_reason": "Mentions the 2024 award winners, implying the most recent year, but lacks the specific game name.", "source_quality": "low"}, {"doc_id": "d5", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "The 2024 Spiel des Jahres winner was the cooperative two-player game Sky Team.", "quote": "the 2024 Spiel des Jahres (German Game of the Year) winner was announced as the cooperative two-player game, Sky Team.", "verdict_reason": "Explicitly names Sky Team as the 2024 Spiel des Jahres winner, directly answering which game won most recently.", "source_quality": "low"}, {"doc_id": "d6", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "Dorfromantik: The Board Game won the 2023 Spiel des Jahres award.", "quote": "Dorfromantik: The Board Game wins the 2023 Spiel des Jahres award Germany's prestigious Spiel des Jahres award goes to Dorfromantik: The Board Game.", "verdict_reason": "Explicitly states that Dorfromantik: The Board Game won the 2023 Spiel des Jahres, directly answering which game won most recently.", "source_quality": "low"}, {"doc_id": "d7", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "Dorfromantik won the Spiel des Jahres award in 2023.", "quote": "Dorfromantik has won Spiel des Jahres 2023", "verdict_reason": "The snippet explicitly states that Dorfromantik won the Spiel des Jahres in 2023, directly answering which game won most recently.", "source_quality": "low"}, {"doc_id": "d8", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "Dorfromantik – The Board Game won the Spiel des Jahres award in 2023.", "quote": "Dorfromantik – The Board Game by Lukas Zach and Michael Palm, published by Pegasus Spiele, has been awarded the title Spiel des Jahres 2023.", "verdict_reason": "Explicitly states that Dorfromantik – The Board Game received the 2023 Spiel des Jahres award, directly answering which game won most recently.", "source_quality": "low"}, {"doc_id": "d9", "verdict": "partially supports", "key_fact": "The snippet mentions that Thurn und Taxis won the Spiel des Jahres in 2006 but only notes it is the most recent winner on the list, not the overall most recent winner.", "quote": "This is the most recent Spiel des Jahres winner on the list, having won in 2006, but it's been regrettably sidelined", "verdict_reason": "It provides a date and winner but clarifies it is only the most recent on that list, not the latest overall award winner.", "source_quality": "low"}], "conflict_reason": "d1, d6–d8 cite Dorfromantik as the 2023 winner, while d3 and d5 update the record to Sky Team as the 2024 winner; d2 and d9 mention even older years.

According to National Geographic, about 70% of the oxygen in the atmosphere comes from marine plants and plant-like organisms. These ocean-living plants release molecular oxygen as a waste product of photosynthesis (as do most plants). In photosynthesis, plants capture sunlight and use its energy to split carbon dioxide and water, making sugar for itself and releasing oxygen as a by-product. The dominance of ocean life as earth's top oxygen producer makes sense when you consider that the majority of the earth is covered with ocean. Of the different types of marine life providing oxygen, the dominant class is phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are microscopic photosynthesizing organisms that live in water. Phytoplankton includes cyanobacteria, green algae, diatoms, and dinoflagellates. Although too small to be visible to the human eye by itself, when many phytoplankton clump together they look like green ocean slime. The oxygen we depend on from breath to breath is provided mostly by a vast army of invisible sea creatures. This image shows global chlorophyll levels averaged from 1997-2006.

Well, that comes from the plant life in the ocean. You May Be Surprised Where Most of Earth’s Oxygen Comes From Our parents and teachers taught us that oxygen comes from trees, just as their parents and teachers taught them, and their parents and teachers before them. When educating our children about where oxygen comes from, we’ll have to change up the narrative because, even though that technically remains true, it’s not even half the story. It’s about 28% of it, to be precise. Trees and rainforests produce approximately 28% of the oxygen on Earth, so what about the other 72%? Well, that comes from the plant life in the ocean. A minuscule marine plant called phytoplankton alone is responsible for 50% of Earth’s oxygen. Until recently it was thought that the trees in the Amazon rainforest alone produced 20% of the Earth’s oxygen; something that had to be thoroughly reconsidered taking into account the level of oxygen produced by marine plants. Climate scientists have since estimated a more reasonable 6–9%. What Are Phytoplankton, and How Do They Make Oxygen? Phytoplankton (meaning drifting plant in Greek) are microscopic organisms that live on the surface of water. They are so tiny that there could be thousands of them in just one droplet of water. Residing in oceans and lakes, they capture sunlight and turn it into chemical energy via photosynthesis, and, just like trees, they make oxygen by consuming carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. In addition to making oxygen, they also provide food for other marine life. Another cool thing about these tiny organisms is that some species of them glow at night. Although each one of them is tiny and cannot be seen by the naked eye, when they are bunched together on the surface of the water, they create a neon-like light that can also ward off predators. However, marine biologists are on the watch for what they call “dead zones.”", "timestamp": "2023-05-04"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "source_url": "https://www.facebook.com/KDHOR/videos/did-you-know-about-70-of-the-earths-oxygen-is-produced-by-the-oceanphytoplankton/1377125476446904/", "snippet": "Did you know..

It’s easy to think of the world’s forests as the planet’s “lungs.” Trees pump out oxygen—the same stuff we breathe in. The bigger the tree the more oxygen it releases. But most of our breathable air doesn’t come from land. It comes from the world’s oceans. And the most important oxygen producers are some of the tiniest organisms on Earth. The air we breathe is 78 percent nitrogen and 21 percent oxygen. The rest is made up of much less common gases, including carbon dioxide. But it wasn’t always that way. Until 600 million years ago, Earth’s atmosphere had less than five percent oxygen. It was mainly a mix of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Land plants didn’t exist until 470 million years ago. Trees weren’t responsible for the increase in oxygen. So where did it come from? The ocean. Plants, algae, and cyanobacteria all create oxygen. They do this through photosynthesis. Using energy from sunlight, they turn carbon dioxide and water into sugar and oxygen. They use the sugars for food. Some oxygen is released into the atmosphere. But oxygen is also used up. Most living cells use it to make energy in a process called cellular respiration. When organisms die, they decompose. Decomposition also uses oxygen. Most oxygen that’s produced gets used up by these two processes. (Used up means the atoms become part of a different molecule. The oxygen atoms are still around, just in a different form.) Diatoms, like this Corethron, use photosynthesis to live, grow, and multiply. Photo by Dawn Moran @Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Over millions of years, tiny single-celled algae and cyanobacteria pumped out oxygen. Much of it got used up in respiration or decomposition. But some of those dead organisms didn’t decompose. They sank deep into the ocean and settled on the bottom. That left a tiny bit of oxygen behind. Instead of being used up, it stayed in the air.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d5", "source_url": "https://www.planetary.org/articles/how-did-earth-get-its-oxygen", "snippet": "How did Earth get its oxygen? | The Planetary Society Today, photosynthetic organisms in Earth's oceans produce roughly half of the planet's oxygen. One particular species, Prochlorococcus, churns ... How did Earth get its oxygen? Thereâs no place like home. Of all the wondrous worlds weâve studied in our Solar System and beyond, none are quite like Earth. Our planet is covered in liquid water and harbors an oxygen-rich atmosphere that has allowed a multitude of plants and animals to evolve â including us. It wasnât always that way. If you could travel back in time to early Earth, your lungs would choke on an atmosphere devoid of oxygen. The gas that humans need to survive didnât appear in significant quantities until roughly halfway through our planetâs current lifespan.

The simple answer is that early microorganisms produced it using a process you may have learned about in elementary school: photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and other organisms use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce energy. As a byproduct, oxygen is released, which has over time given Earth an oxygen-rich atmosphere suitable for complex lifeforms. Exactly how the Cosmos set the stage for this to happen is not known with complete certainty, but we know the basics. Letâs start at the beginning.

With Every Breath You Take, Thank the Ocean When was the last time you thought about your breathing? Take a breath right now and think about it. You breathe because you need oxygen, a gas which makes up 21 percent of the Earth’s atmosphere. All that oxygen has to come from somewhere. You might already know that it comes from photosynthetic organisms like plants. But did you know that most of the oxygen you breathe comes from organisms in the ocean? Scientists use satellite images of the ocean to estimate chlorophyll concentrations in the water.(NASA, Robert Simmon and Jesse Allen) Photosynthesizers have been in the ocean for a long time. Land plants start appearing in the fossil record 470 million years ago, before dinosaurs roamed the earth. But the ocean was producing oxygen for billions of years before that. The oldest known fossil is from a marine cyanobacterium, a tiny-blue green photosynthesizer that was releasing oxygen 3.5 billion years ago. In a way, we owe the ocean for all of the oxygen that comes from land plants as well, because land plants evolved from green marine algae. If there were a race to put oxygen in the atmosphere, the ocean would have one heck of a head start. But the ocean’s long history of photosynthesis would matter very little to us if not for the photosynthesizers that live in it today. Of these, the most impressive is another cyanobacterium called Prochlorococcus. It is estimated to be more abundant than any other photosynthesizer on the planet, and to be responsible for producing 20 percent of the oxygen in the atmosphere. One in every five breaths you take, you owe to Prochlorococcus. Perhaps as amazing is the fact that scientists only discovered this super-abundant photosynthesizer in 1988—less than thirty years ago!

What is now called a \"regular\" veto is a case in which the President returns a bill to Congress (to the House in which it originated). The veto may be overridden by 2/3 vote of both Houses of Congress. The Constitution also specifies that if the President does not veto or sign a bill within 10 days (excluding Sundays), it becomes a law. This prevents the President from killing legislation through simple inaction. The exception is if Congress has adjourned before the 10 days are up--thereby preventing a possible return with a veto. In that case the legislation does not become law. This situation permits what has been called a \"pocket veto\"--when the President does not return the legislation to Congress, but simply does not act. In that case the bill does not become law. During the 20th century controversy arose about the meaning of the word \"adjournment\" and the possibility for a pocket veto. Did this refer only to ajournment between Congresses (\"adjournment sine die\") or between sessions, or did it refer to any break (e.g., a \"recess.\") which might occur at the end of the 10-day period for a President to act on legislation? In general, now Congress can provide for an \"appropriate officer\" to receive a President's veto message, and opportunity for prompt consideration of an override vote. Presidents may still assert a pocket veto, but accompany it with a message setting forth their objections, so that there will be no confusion as to whether the legislation was vetoed or should have automatically become law.", "timestamp": "2004-02-01"}, {"doc_id": "d7", "source_url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-7/clause-2/the-veto-power", "snippet": "The Veto Power | U.S. Constitution Annotated | US Law The Presentment Clause allows the President to veto legislation, preventing it from taking effect unless two thirds of both the House and Senate vote to ...

Learn how a bill becomes a law and how the process is different in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. How a bill becomes a law A bill is a proposal for a new law or a change to an existing law. The idea for a bill can come from a sitting member of the U.S. Senate or House of Representatives or be proposed during their election campaign. Bills can also be petitioned by people or citizen groups who recommend a new or amended law to a member of Congress that represents them. Once a bill is introduced, it is assigned to a committee whose members will research, discuss, and make changes to the bill. The bill is then put before that chamber to be voted on. If the bill passes one body of Congress, it goes to the other body to go through a similar process of research, discussion, changes, and voting. Once both bodies vote to accept a bill, they must work out any differences between the two versions. Then both chambers vote on the same version of the bill. If it passes, they present it to the president. The president then considers the bill. The president can approve the bill and sign it into law. Or the president can refuse to approve a bill. This is called a veto. If the president chooses to veto a bill, in most cases Congress can vote to override that veto and the bill becomes a law. But if the president does not sign off on a bill and it remains unsigned when Congress is no longer in session, the bill will be vetoed by default. This action is called a pocket veto, and it cannot be overridden by Congress. How the House and Senateâs lawmaking procedures are different The Senate and the House have some procedural differences. While both are equal in how they function, only the House can initiate tax and revenue-related legislation. And only the Senate can draft legislation related to presidential nominations and treaties. While the House processes legislation through a majority vote, the Senate does so through deliberation and debate prior to voting.", "timestamp": "2024-11-05"}, {"doc_id": "d9", "source_url": "https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article5/section6/", "snippet": "powers of Governor; vetoes and amendments - Virginia Law The Governor shall either sign or veto a bill returned to him from a reconvened session.

The legislative branch has the power ... The Constitution divided the Government into three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. That was an important decision because it gave specific powers to each branch and set up something called checks and balances. Just like the phrase sounds, the point of checks and balances was to make sure no one branch would be able to control too much power, and it created a separation of powers. Here are some examples of how the different branches work together: The legislative branch makes laws, but the President in the executive branch can veto those laws with a Presidential Veto. The legislative branch makes laws, but the judicial branch can declare those laws unconstitutional. The executive branch, through the Federal agencies, has responsibility for day-to-day enforcement and administration of Federal laws. These Federal departments and agencies have missions and responsibilities that vary widely, from environmental protection to protecting the Nation’s borders. The President in the executive branch can veto a law, but the legislative branch can override that veto with enough votes. The legislative branch has the power to approve Presidential nominations, control the budget, and can impeach the President and remove him or her from office. The executive branch can declare Executive Orders, which are like proclamations that carry the force of law, but the judicial branch can declare those acts unconstitutional. The judicial branch interprets laws, but the President nominates Supreme Court justices, court of appeals judges, and district court judges who make the evaluations. The judicial branch interprets laws, but the Senate in the legislative branch confirms the President’s nominations for judicial positions, and Congress can impeach any of those judges and remove them from office. See our \"Branches of Government\" infographic to find the checks and balances you see illustrated. In this Learning Adventure, we’ll find out who designed the Branches of Government and why they’re so important. In 1787, when the United States was still a new country, a meeting of State delegates gathered to make decisions about how the Government would be run. The meeting was called the Constitutional Convention.

Historical Federal Executions The U.S. Marshal has been historically assigned the task of conducting the death sentences on those condemned by federal courts. This stemmed from \"An Act for the Punishment of certain Crimes against the United States\" (April 30, 1790) and the Judiciary Act of 1789. Convicted of President Lincoln's Assassination, Surratt, David Herold, George Atzerodt and Paine were hanged on the grounds of present-day Fort McNair. The first known federal execution under this authority was conducted by U.S. Marshal Henry Dearborn of Maine on June 25, 1790. He was ordered to execute one Thomas Bird for murder on the high seas. In coordinating this, Dearborn spent money on building a gallows and coffin. Later, as U.S. Marshals saw more death sentences imposed, a few districts resorted to more permanent equipment. U.S. Marshal E.D. Nix of Oklahoma had a portable scaffold that could be easily packed for travel in 1894. Most death sentences required use of the gallows until the mid Twentieth Century. The famous “Hanging Judge,” the Honorable Isaac Parker of the Western District of Arkansas, ordered 160 known executions, of which 79 were actually carried out after the appeals and commutation process. Often hangings created a spectacle, so most crowds were kept at a distance. The Western District resorted to tickets to distinguish relatives and witnesses from the curious.

Freedom of opinion and expression are, indeed, cornerstones of human rights and pillars of free and democratic societies. These freedoms support other fundamental rights, such as to peaceful assembly, to participate in public affairs, and to freedom of religion. It is undeniable that digital media, including social media, have bolstered the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas. Therefore, legislative efforts to regulate free expression unsurprisingly raise concerns that attempts to curb hate speech may silence dissent and opposition. To counter hate speech, the United Nations supports more positive speech and upholds respect for freedom of expression as the norm. Therefore, any restrictions must be an exception and seek to prevent harm and ensure equality or the public participation of all. Alongside the relevant international human rights law provisions, the UN Rabat Plan of Action provides key guidance to States on the difference between freedom of expression and “incitement” (to discrimination, hostility and violence), which is prohibited under criminal law. Determining when the potential of harm is high enough to justify prohibiting speech is still the subject of much debate. But States can also use alternative tools – such as education and promoting counter-messages – to address the whole spectrum of hateful expression, both on and offline. “Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech. It means keeping hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under international law.”", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d2", "source_url": "https://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/hate", "snippet": "Hate Speech and Hate Crime | Advocacy, Legislation & Issues Hate Speech and Hate Crime Hate Speech There is no legal definition of \"hate speech\" under U.S. law, just as there is no legal definition for evil ideas, rudeness, unpatriotic speech, or any other kind of speech that people might condemn. Generally, however, hate speech is any form of expression through which speakers intend to vilify, humiliate, or incite hatred against a group or a class of persons on the basis of race, religion, skin color sexual identity, gender identity, ethnicity, disability, or national origin. 1 In the United States, hate speech is protected by the First Amendment. Courts extend this protection on the grounds that the First Amendment requires the government to strictly protect robust debate on matters of public concern even when such debate devolves into distasteful, offensive, or hateful speech that causes others to feel grief, anger, or fear. (The Supreme Court's decision in Snyder v. Phelps provides an example of this legal reasoning.) Under current First Amendment jurisprudence, hate speech can only be criminalized when it directly incites imminent criminal activity or consists of specific threats of violence targeted against a person or group. Hate Crime For the purposes of collecting statistics, the FBI has defined a hate crime as a “criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity,” including skin color and national origin. Hate crimes are overt acts that can include acts of violence against persons or property, violation or deprivation of civil rights, certain \"true threats,\" or acts of intimidation, or conspiracy to commit these crimes. The Supreme Court has upheld laws that either criminalize these acts or impose a harsher punishment when it can be proven that the defendant targeted the victim because of the victim's race, ethnicity, identity, or beliefs. A hate crime is more than than offensive speech or conduct; it is specific criminal behavior that ranges from property crimes like vandalism and arson to acts of intimidation, assault, and murder.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d3", "source_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_in_the_United_States", "snippet": "Hate speech in the United States - Wikipedia Hate speech in the United States cannot be directly regulated by the government due to the fundamental right to freedom of speech protected by the Constitution.[1] While \"hate speech\" is not a legal term in the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that most of what would qualify as hate speech in other western countries is legally protected speech under the First Amendment. In a Supreme Court case on the issue, Matal v. Tam (2017), the justices unanimously reaffirmed that there is effectively no \"hate speech\" exception to the free speech rights protected by the First Amendment and that the U.S. government may not discriminate against speech on the basis of the speaker's viewpoint.[2] In academic circles, there has been debate over freedom of speech, hate speech, and hate speech legislation.[3] Other forms of speech have lesser protection under court interpretations of the First Amendment, including commercial speech, \"fighting words\", and obscenity. The protection of civil liberties, including freedom of speech, was not written into the original 1788 Constitution of the United States but was added two years later with the Bill of Rights, implemented as several amendments to the Constitution. The First Amendment, ratified December 15, 1791, provides (in relevant part) that \"Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press\". The Fourteenth Amendment, ratified on July 9, 1868, has been interpreted by the Supreme Court as extending this prohibition to laws enacted by the states. In 1942, the issue of group defamation was first most explicitly brought up in Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, which surrounded the issue of a Jehovah's Witness, Walter Chaplinsky, who verbally attacked a town marshal for restricting his use of a public sidewalk to protest organized religion by calling him a \"damned fascist\" and \"racketeer.\"[4]", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d4", "source_url": "http://www.aclu.org/documents/freedom-expression-aclu-position-paper", "snippet": "Freedom of Expression - ACLU Position Paper | American Civil ... The ACLU has often been at the center of controversy for defending the free speech rights of groups that spew hate, such as the Ku Klux Klan and the Nazis. But if only popular ideas were protected, we wouldn’t need a First Amendment. History teaches that the first target of government repression is never the last. If we do not come to the defense of the free speech rights of the most unpopular among us, even if their views are antithetical to the very freedom the First Amendment stands for, then no one’s liberty will be secure. In that sense, all First Amendment rights are “indivisible.” Censoring so-called hate speech also runs counter to the long-term interests of the most frequent victims of hate: racial, ethnic, religious and sexual minorities. We should not give the government the power to decide which opinions are hateful, for history has taught us that government is more apt to use this power to prosecute minorities than to protect them. As one federal judge has put it, tolerating hateful speech is “the best protection we have against any Nazi-type regime in this country.” At the same time, freedom of speech does not prevent punishing conduct that intimidates, harasses, or threatens another person, even if words are used. Threatening phone calls, for example, are not constitutionally protected. SPEECH & NATIONAL SECURITY The Supreme Court has recognized the government’s interest in keeping some information secret, such as wartime troop deployments. But the Court has never actually upheld an injunction against speech on national security grounds. Two lessons can be learned from this historical fact. First, the amount of speech that can be curtailed in the interest of national security is very limited. And second, the government has historically overused the concept of “national security” to shield itself from criticism, and to discourage public discussion of controversial policies or decisions. In 1971, the publication of the “Pentagon Papers” by the New York Times brought the conflicting claims of free speech and national security to a head.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d5", "source_url": "https://www.aclu.org/news/free-speech/free-speech-can-be-messy-we-need-it", "snippet": "Free Speech Can Be Messy, but We Need It | ACLU Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.

She was going to speak, school officials said there would be riots, and they canceled her talk. Both of these individuals then spent 2017 identifying as victims of liberal censorship.

A goal of professional provocateurs is to provoke the campus community into trying to silence them. Think of campus trolls as schoolyard bullies. Oh, their words definitely hurt. But the real question is: How do we respond to that hurt? A troll wants you to censor them. It feeds into their power and gives them something to sell. You don’t have to play that role. Yes, there is power in hateful words. But there is also power in sass — in unwillingness to be goaded into a fight or to play the role of censor. But not all words wound in the same way.

Respect for the autonomy rights of speakers is a commitment of liberal justice, but it is not the only commitment. When the non-violation of the autonomy rights of speakers foreseeably leads to policies which will violate other, foundational, commitments of liberal justice such as the equal basic rights of citizens, it is unclear that violating the autonomy rights of speakers is unjustified, all things considered. My position here is, I believe, consistent with Rawls’s views about the priority of a coherent scheme of basic liberties. Priority for a scheme of liberties rather than for any one liberty ‘implies in practice that a basic liberty can be limited or denied solely for the sake of one or more other basic liberties, [but never] for reasons of public good or of perfectionist values’ (Rawls (1993, p. 295). Having suggested that restrictions on this category of hate speech do not violate unjustly free speech rights, and in light of the obvious harms of such speech, I conclude that this hate speech category is clearly covered as political speech, but nonetheless unprotected and therefore regulable. I would stress, however, that my position is silent on whether such speech should be regulated, and is certainly silent on the authority question—who should decide when speech properly counts as falling within this category, in virtue of its foreseeably leading to the adoption of policies which exclude or eliminate identifiable racial or religious groups. It may be the case that no government can reliably be given the authority to make this difficult judgment without opening the way for abuse. Even if that is the case, however, my position here is, in my view, not affected—it deals with the first-order question of whether this category of speech is in principle regulable under the FSP.

Speech cannot be punished just because of its hateful content. But when you get beyond content and look at context, speech with a hateful message may be punished, if in a particular context it directly causes certain specific, imminent, serious harm — such as a genuine threat that means to instill a reasonable fear on the part of the person at whom the threat is targeted that he or she is going be subject to violence. On feeling physically threatened by hateful speech Not only threatened. You can feel emotionally disturbed. You can feel psychic trauma, which can have physiological manifestations. You can feel silenced. These are all real harms that may be suffered by people who are subject to hate speech that is not punishable. [Because] even though we acknowledge those harms, loosening up the constraints on government to allow it to punish speech because of those less tangible, more speculative, more indirect harms — that censorial power will do more harm that good, precisely because the pendulum can swing. Not that shockingly long ago it was left-wing speakers, communists and socialist, who were kept off campuses.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d8", "source_url": "https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/freedom-of-expression/", "snippet": "Freedom of Expression - Amnesty International FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION Overview Your voice matters. You have the right to say what you think, share information and demand a better world. You also have the right to agree or disagree with those in power, and to express these opinions in peaceful protests. Exercising these rights – without fear or unlawful interference – is central to living in an open and fair society; one in which people can access justice and enjoy their human rights. Yet governments around the world routinely imprison people – or worse – for speaking out, even though almost every country’s constitution refers to the value of ‘free speech’. Governments have a duty to prohibit hateful, inciteful speech but many abuse their authority to silence peaceful dissent by passing laws criminalizing freedom of expression. This is often done in the name of counterterrorism, national security or religion. More recently, freedom of expression has come under threat by authorities clamping down on activists, NGOs and individuals helping refugees and migrants. How governments tolerate unfavourable views or critical voices is often a good indication of how they treat human rights generally. Amnesty International supports people who speak out peacefully for themselves and for others – whether a journalist reporting on violence by security forces, a trade unionist exposing poor working conditions or an indigenous leader defending their land rights against big business. We would similarly defend the right of those who support the positions of big business, the security forces and employers to express their views peacefully. We consider anyone put in prison solely for exercising their right to free speech peacefully to be a prisoner of conscience and call for their immediate and unconditional release. Key facts Article 19 Freedom of Expression is protected by Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Why is freedom of expression important? The right to freedom of expression is enshrined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which sets out in broad terms the human rights that each of us has. It was later protected legally by a raft of international and regional treaties.

It will also create new, aggravated forms of certain existing criminal offences, where those offences are motivated by hatred of a protected characteristic. These will carry an enhanced penalty and the criminal record will clearly state that the offence was a hate crime. A number of key changes have been made since the General Scheme of the Bill was published in April 2021 and are reflected in the full Bill as approved by Cabinet. Among these, the Bill now includes a general provision to further protect genuine freedom of expression and clarifies that a communication is not taken to incite violence or hatred solely on the basis that it involves discussion or criticism of matters relating to a protected characteristic. However, Minister McEntee said that hate speech is not about free speech – hate speech is designed to shut people down, to shut them up, to make them afraid to say who they are and to exclude and isolate them. Other updates since the General Scheme include the inclusion of a demonstration test for hate crimes to make it easier to secure prosecutions and convictions for crimes motivated by hate. This will be an additional/alternative test to the ‘motivation test’ as previously outlined in the General Scheme of the Bill. Minister McEntee said: “We are all horrified when we hear of homophobic, racist, and other hateful incidents in our country. While these repulsive acts of violence and abuse against innocent people have been extensively reported on, we know that some people go about their lives constantly in fear of abuse simply because of who they are. “Although it is a small minority of individuals carrying out these reprehensible acts and spouting this abuse, there is a clear desire from the public that these individuals need to be dealt with in the appropriate way. “This Bill provides separately for hate crime and for hate speech, but on the basis of the same protected characteristics.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d10", "source_url": "https://lop.parl.ca/sites/PublicWebsite/default/en_CA/ResearchPublications/201825E", "snippet": "Hate Speech and Freedom of Expression: Legal Boundaries in ... 1 Introduction Although Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights1 proclaims that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression, many countries have laws that censor or limit certain types of expression, including speech that incites violence and hatred. Some free speech advocates prefer an open marketplace of ideas, where no expression is restricted. They consider that the best response to harmful speech is through debate that lets different ideas freely challenge it. Others argue that restrictions on hate speech are vital to the protection of minority communities from the harm that such speech causes.2 Different approaches to what is acceptable speech can be seen around the world. The United States of America has traditionally been a country where the constitutional protection of free speech is vigorously defended.3 And yet, even there, many restrictions on free speech do exist, such as those against speech that incites “imminent lawless action”4 and those that censor obscenity.5 Some countries show a greater acceptance than others for prohibiting certain forms of speech and even the expression of certain opinions. For instance, some European countries have passed laws in accordance with a European Union Council decision to make it a punishable offence not only to incite hatred, but also to publicly deny crimes of genocide (e.g., the Holocaust) or war crimes.6 In other countries, strict limitations on free speech may go as far as to impose the death penalty for such crimes as apostasy, blasphemy or other statements that may be perceived to be opposed to the dominant religion.7 In Canada, various laws at the federal, provincial and territorial levels impose restrictions on the freedom of expression guaranteed by section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.8 For instance, under the Criminal Code,9 such actions as defamatory libel, counselling suicide, perjury and fraud are prohibited. In 1990, then Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada Antonio Lamer described offences that address forms of speech or expression as falling under the following categories: offences against the public order, offences related to falsehood, offences against the person and reputation, offences against the administration of law and justice, and offences related to public morals and disorderly conduct.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d11", "source_url": "https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/967/hate-speech", "snippet": "Hate Speech | The First Amendment Encyclopedia Hate Speech The Supreme Court has struck down laws that have restricted offensive speech, such as the wearing of swastikas in Village of Skokie v. National Socialist Party of America. But in Virginia v. Black, the Supreme Court declined to rule that cross-burning was protected expressive speech under the First Amendment when such an activity was intended to intimidate, reasoning that sometimes it can constitute a \"true threat.\" (Photo of Ku Klux Klansmen and women at a cross lighting in 2005 via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0) The term “hate speech” is generally agreed to mean abusive language specifically attacking a person or persons because of their race, color, religion, ethnic group, gender, or sexual orientation. Although the First Amendment still protects much hate speech, there has been substantial debate on the subject in the past two decades among lawmakers, jurists, and legal scholars. Debate over hate speech flared over campus speech codes The scholarly debate concerning the regulation of hate speech flared in the late 1980s, primarily focusing on campus speech codes, pitting those who view regulation of hate speech as a necessary step toward social equality against those who see hate speech regulations as abridgements of the fundamental right of free speech. Liberal theorists say more speech is the First Amendment remedy for hate speech The traditional liberal position is that speech must be valued as one of the most important elements of a democratic society. Traditional scholars see speech as a fundamental tool for self-realization and social growth and believe that the remedy for troublesome speech is more speech, not more government regulation of speech. For example, liberal theorist Nadine Strossen, relying to some degree on John Stuart Mill’s connection between speech and the search for truth, argues that restricting hate speech will mask hatred among groups rather than dissipate it. Balance between free speech and social equality a concern Proponents of hate speech regulation usually do so from the perspective of critical race theory, believing that legal decisions are based on preserving the interests of the powerful, and see no value in protecting bias-motivated speech against certain already oppressed groups.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d12", "source_url": "https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/hate-speech-and-violence", "snippet": "Hate speech and violence - European Commission against Racism ... Hate speech and violence Hate speech covers many forms of expressions which advocate, incite, promote or justify hatred, violence and discrimination against a person or group of persons for a variety of reasons. It poses grave dangers for the cohesion of a democratic society, the protection of human rights and the rule of law. If left unaddressed, it can lead to acts of violence and conflict on a wider scale. In this sense hate speech is an extreme form of intolerance which contributes to hate crime. Aware of the dangerous link between hate speech and violence, ECRI has always considered that criminal prohibition is necessary when hate speech publicly incites violence against individuals or groups of people. At the same time criminal sanctions should be used as a measure of last resort and, all along, a balance must be kept between fighting hate speech on the one hand, and safeguarding freedom of speech on the other. Any restrictions on hate speech should not be misused to silence minorities and to suppress criticism of official policies, political opposition or religious beliefs. In many instances, ECRI has found that an effective approach to tackling hate speech, in particular cyberhate, is self-regulation by public and private institutions, media and the Internet industry, such as the adoption of codes of conduct accompanied by sanctions for non-compliance. Education and counter-speech are also equally important in fighting the misconceptions and misinformation that form the basis of hate speech. Therefore, ECRI considers that effective action against the use of hate speech requires raising public awareness of the importance of respecting pluralism and of the dangers posed by hate speech. Underreporting of hate speech and hate-motivated violence is another unfortunate feature of these two phenomena. Victims rarely report incidents to the authorities for fear of retaliation or of not being taken seriously, or because they have no confidence in the justice system. This contributes to lack data which makes it difficult to quantify the extent of the problem and take effective measures to address it. ECRI recommends states to provide practical support to those targeted by hate speech and violence: they should be made aware of their rights to redress through administrative, civil and criminal proceedings and encouraged to report to the authorities, and receive legal and psychological assistance.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d13", "source_url": "https://geneva.usmission.gov/2012/08/27/curtailing-freedom-of-expression-is-not-the-way-to-combat-hateful-speech/", "snippet": "Curtailing Freedom of Expression is not the Way to Combat Hateful ... The progress we have made, we have accomplished without banning speech or restricting freedom of expression. In light of this framework, the United States has long made clear its concerns over resorting to restrictions on freedom of expression, association, and assembly[1] in order to promote tolerance and respect. This concern includes the restrictions contained in Article 4 of the CERD to the extent that they might be interpreted as allowing or requiring restrictions on forms of expression that do not constitute incitement to imminent violence or acts of intimidation. Indeed, these concerns were so fundamental that the United States took a reservation, when it became a Party to the CERD, noting it would not accept any obligation that could limit the extensive protections for such fundamental freedoms guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution.[2] Banning and punishing offensive and hateful speech is neither an effective approach to combating such intolerance, nor an appropriate role for government in seeking to promote respect for diversity. As President Obama stated in a speech delivered in Cairo, Egypt in June 2009, suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away. In fact to do so can be counterproductive and even raise the profile of such ideas. We believe the best antidote to offensive and hateful speech is constructive dialogue that counters and responds to such speech by refuting it through principled arguments, causing the hateful speech to fall under its own weight. In addition, we believe government should speak out against such offensive speech, and employ tools to address intolerance that include a combination of robust legal protections against discrimination and hate crimes, proactive government outreach, education, and the vigorous defense of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression. Accordingly, the United States has a strong interest in the subject of this hearing and shares the following views in the hopes that they will help shed light on the need to promote respect for broad protections for freedoms of expression in the ongoing global struggle to combat racial discrimination.

But the categories are much narrower than Austin’s performative utterances (Greenawalt 1989, 58). This is particularly evident in relation to the treatment of performatives in Austin’s later lectures: once the dichotomy of performatives and descriptive statements is abandoned, there is an enormous family of related ‘speech-acts’ – utterances with both locutionary content and illocutionary force – which contain an immense range of expression (Austin 1975, Lecture XII, esp. 150). Greenawalt was concerned to elucidate the appropriate constitutional and legal approaches to the understanding of language rather than the purely philosophical questions canvassed by Austin. The practical consequences of their different approaches can be teased out in the context of hate speech; in particular it can be asked how far the freedom of speech principle applies to extreme racist and other hate speech, or whether such speech falls outside the scope of the principle as might be the case if its dissemination constitutes harm. For Greenawalt hate speech is clearly covered by a free speech principle or constitutional clause, as is political speech generally; racist speech reveals the speaker’s beliefs, and may even provide information about the world, though it will generally consist of bogus claims, as in the case of Holocaust denial. In his view (Greenawalt 1989, 300–301) that was what happened in the Beauharnais group libel case where a racist pamphlet had made highly provocative claims about the incidence of Black crime in Chicago: it was wrong for the Supreme Court to have ruled the speech outside the scope of the First Amendment.

Many universities recommend that students complete a year of basic art and design courses during high school to develop and learn the fundamentals of art and design. It’s essential for students to find out the specific requirements for the school or university you’re applying to and retrieve as much information as possible from your high school’s art department, guidance counselors, and other administration to help you learn and get started in the application process. For most entry-level and advanced graphic design positions, you will need a minimum of a bachelor’s degree from an accredited university, college, or private design school. However, if you are seeking an associate’s degree, you can obtain your certification from a variety of schools. Upon graduation, a 2-year degree will allow you to try assistant-level positions within the graphic design field. For those who already possess a bachelor’s degree in another major, you can complete a 2 or 3-year program in graphic design to learn the technical requirements and receive the certification needed to pursue a career in this field. If you are going back to college (continuing education), it’s usually best to contact the admissions office of whatever school you’re applying to find out the application process and what will be required (i.e., portfolio samples, transcripts, resume, etc.). Your Curriculum: What to Expect Depending on what area of graphic design you wish to pursue, your curriculum may include website visual design, studio art, computerized design, motion graphics, printing techniques, commercial graphics production, typography, and other similar coursework that falls under a fine art or graphic design program.

Share Always dreamed of starting a career in graphic design but don’t have the time or resources to go to art school? Many successful graphic designers have pursued creative careers in unconventional ways. Below, we explain how to get into graphic design without a degree and highlight a professional graphic designer who did exactly that. Do You Need a Degree to Be a Graphic Designer? While some graphic designers certainly use a college degree to enter the creative field, it’s not a requirement. Many companies hire entry level designers based solely on their portfolio and experience, rather than if they have a degree. With that in mind, there are a few things you will need as a graphic designer without degree: some amount of raw creative talent, the dedication to learn several critical skills, and an impressive portfolio that will convince employers to take a chance on you. The last is perhaps the most important in the job-hunting process. You must have a portfolio of work to demonstrate your creativity and design skills, so potential employers have something concrete on which to base a hiring decision. Even if you don’t have an art degree, you will need a portfolio of your graphic design work to present to potential employers. Skills You Need as a Designer While you can learn how to be a graphic designer without a degree, you will still need a few basic skills to succeed in a professional graphic design environment. Software Skills Whether or not you have a degree, you will need to have a good grasp on design software.

What graphic designers do: Graphic designers are responsible for creating the graphics and visuals that appear in magazines, advertisements, websites, and other forms of media. They may work for a design firm, or they may freelance. A graphic designer’s job involves more than just creating pretty pictures. They must understand the principles of design, colour theory, typography, and layout. They must also be able to use computers to create graphics and manipulate photographs. Graphic designers often collaborate with copywriters, web developers, marketing professionals, and others to create an entire visual branding package for a company or product. They must be able to think creatively and be able to communicate their ideas effectively. Graphic design isn’t just for people with degrees Design isn’t just for people with degrees.

Do you need a degree to become a graphic designer? No, a degree is not required to become a graphic designer. Only a minority of companies hire designers exclusively based on their educational background, and most are much more interested in the applicants’ design portfolio and relevant work experience. Here’s why the value of a college degree is declining in the field of graphic design: Self-teaching. Teaching yourself graphic design skills is much more common in the design industry than in other professions, removing the need for a degree altogether. Plus, the proliferation of online tutorials, courses, and YouTube videos has made it easier to replace formal education with self-education. Accessibility. The tools used by graphic designers have never been as accessible as they are now. Due to technological advancements, virtually anyone with a computer, the skills, and the right software can enter the graphic design industry without formal education or networking. Freelancing opportunities. The rise of freelancing and the gig economy has made it easier for designers to find work without going through traditional channels and meeting employer requirements. Many high-profile clients are happy to hire freelance graphic designers they found online, as long as they have an impressive portfolio. Even if you leave freelance graphic design jobs out of the equation, the data shows that most graphic designer jobs don’t require a degree in 2022. This chart shows the job availabilities for graphic designers without a degree worldwide: As you can see, most graphic design jobs, whether in the United States or elsewhere, do not require applicants to have a college degree.

A certificate in the field, or an associate's degree, may be sufficient in some cases, but the U.S. Department of Labor reports that fledgling designers are much more likely to land a quality job only after earning a bachelor's degree. There are currently approximately 300 post-secondary institutions in the U.S. that offer degree programs accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design. School options run the gamut from large public universities, to small private colleges, to prestigious art institutes. There are also a growing number of online programs available.

General Motors has said it aims to stop selling new gasoline-powered cars and light trucks by 2035 and will pivot to battery-powered models. This week, Volvo said it would move even faster and introduce an all-electric lineup by 2030. But as electric cars and trucks go mainstream, they have faced a persistent question: Are they really as green as advertised? While experts broadly agree that plug-in vehicles are a more climate-friendly option than traditional vehicles, they can still have their own environmental impacts, depending on how they’re charged up and manufactured. Here’s a guide to some of the biggest worries — and how they might be addressed. One way to compare the climate impacts of different vehicle models is with this interactive online tool by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who tried to incorporate all the relevant factors: the emissions involved in manufacturing the cars and in producing gasoline and diesel fuel, how much gasoline conventional cars burn, and where the electricity to charge electric vehicles comes from. If you assume electric vehicles are drawing their power from the average grid in the United States, which typically includes a mix of fossil fuel and renewable power plants, then they’re almost always much greener than conventional cars. Even though electric vehicles are more emissions-intensive to make because of their batteries, their electric motors are more efficient than traditional internal combustion engines that burn fossil fuels. An all-electric Chevrolet Bolt, for instance, can be expected to produce 189 grams of carbon dioxide for every mile driven over its lifetime, on average. By contrast, a new gasoline-fueled Toyota Camry is estimated to produce 385 grams of carbon dioxide per mile. A new Ford F-150 pickup truck, which is even less fuel-efficient, produces 636 grams of carbon dioxide per mile.

Bottom line: Reichmuth’s team compared an average gas-powered sedan (32 miles per gallon) with an average-efficiency EV (300-mile-range battery) and found that the EV reduces total lifetime emissions by 52%. “You can also think of it as the manufacturing emissions being a deficit or debt that is sort of ‘paid back’ by emissions savings,” Reichmuth said. For the average driver — one who drives about 10,650 miles a year — “there’s a net climate benefit as long as that car’s on the road for two years,” Reichmuth said. “And most of these cars are being driven 10 to 15 years, so it really is a net benefit.” More clean power and innovation are likely to cut pollution from electric vehicle manufacturing In the future, adding more renewables to the power mix and continuing to make other technological advances are likely to help reduce the climate impacts of EV manufacturing. “Some of those manufacturing emissions will be helped as we both clean up the grid and clean up transportation,” he said. Reichmuth’s research looked at what would happen if car manufacturers switch to using renewable energy at their factories. “If you’re using 100% carbon-free electricity in battery manufacturing,” he said, “it would reduce battery emissions by 27%.” Some emissions result from transporting materials from the point of extraction to production facilities, so electrifying the industrial trucking sector would also help improve manufacturing’s climate footprint. Verdict: electric cars are already better for the climate than gas-fueled vehicles — but there’s room for improvement. ​The transportation sector accounts for about 27% of total U.S. climate-warming pollution, making it the largest contributor to the nation’s emissions.

However, it is not uncommon to read or hear that electric cars would be worse for the climate than ICE. So, what do the studies say? Is going electric better in France? What about in other countries in the world? Which phase(s) of the life cycle of an electric car and a ICE emit the most? What other issues relating to cars in general, electric cars may solve (or not)? How do we ensure a sustainable and virtuous development for electric cars? Let’s try and untangle this (electric!) debate… Electric car or Internal Combustion Engine car, which one is better? Several studies have analysed and compared the GHGs of ICE versus electric cars in France, by taking into account all stages of the lifecycle of a car, from the production of the vehicle to its end of life, including its use and maintenance. We call it: “life cycle analysis” (or LCAs). The studies found that, in France, emissions are around 2 to 5 times lower for an electric car than for a ICE (petrol or diesel). The image below summarises the 10 studies compiled for France over the past 10 years Results of the main life cycle assessments on Internal Combustion Engine and electric cars for France In France, electric cars are better. What about the rest of the world? In Germany, China…? The energy mix used to recharge EV batteries strongly impacts their carbon footprint. In France, the low-carbon electricity mix thus gives a strong advantage compared to other countries.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d5", "source_url": "https://www.ucsusa.org/about/news/cleaner-now-ever-driving-electric-cars-and-trucks-cuts-global-warming-emissions", "snippet": "Cleaner Now Than Ever: Driving Electric Cars and Trucks Cuts ... Washington (July 25, 2022)—The future of transportation is electric—and that future has real benefits not just for electric vehicle drivers, but for everyone. As more drivers make the switch to electric vehicles, that means a cleaner, healthier future with less global warming emissions. In a new analysis, “Driving Cleaner: How Electric Cars and Pick-Ups Beat Gasoline on Lifetime Global Warming Emissions,” the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) shows that switching to electric cars or pickup trucks from comparable gasoline vehicles is one of the most effective ways we can reduce emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change. On average, electric vehicles produce less than half the global warming emissions that come from driving a similar gasoline vehicle. This advantage has grown with a cleaner electrical grid and more efficient EV technology. And that advantage holds over the whole lifetime of the vehicle, from manufacture to driving to disposal. Transportation is the largest source of global warming emissions in the U.S., and more than half of that pollution comes from passenger cars, trucks, and SUVs. Making the emissions cuts we need to fight climate change means electrifying the cars and trucks that we use to get around. “The electric vehicle market is poised to grow dramatically, with more options than ever, from small cars to pickup trucks,” said David Reichmuth, senior vehicles engineer in the Clean Transportation Program at UCS. “This is an exciting moment—and drivers can be confident that by making the switch, they’ll be helping to rein in climate change.” Today, the average electric vehicle is so clean that the global warming emissions are the equivalent of driving a car getting 91 miles to the gallon. For 90 percent of the country, driving an electric vehicle is cleaner than driving even the most efficient gasoline vehicle. That’s up from two-thirds of the country in 2015—a remarkable improvement in less than a decade, thanks mostly to an increasingly clean electric grid. Manufacturers are delivering electric versions of more vehicle models, and that’s especially important for pickup trucks, a growing part of the passenger vehicle market.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d6", "source_url": "https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/09/19/why-tech-companies-are-wrong-to-think-electric-cars-are-a-solution-to-climate-change", "snippet": "Why tech companies are wrong to think electric cars are a solution to ...

It’s true that fully electric vehicles do not emit waste products but the batteries that supply energy to the vehicle are made of minerals like lithium and cobalt which have an impact on climate change. “In order to create an electric car, a lot of minerals need to be mined and much of that will continue to happen in the global south. And those mines have incredible environmental and health impacts in the places that they exist,” explained Marx.

The car companies certainly want you to think they will, proposing electric cars as the latest thing to buy and lobbying for tax credits and incentives for electric car purchases. However, electric vehicles won't solve our carbon emissions challenge fast enough – and prioritizing cars as a transportation method is extremely inefficient when it comes to space in our cities, another crucial part of the climate change equation.

There is an urgent need to pursue both EV uptake and demand side solutions. Abstract The decarbonisation of the road transport sector is increasingly seen as a necessary component to meet global and national targets as specified in the Paris Agreement. It may be achieved best by shifting from Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) cars to Electric Vehicles (EVs). However, the transition to a low carbon mode of transport will not be instantaneous and any policy or technological change implemented now will take years to have the desired effect. Within this paper we show how on-road emission factors of EVs and models of embedded CO2 in the vehicle production may be combined with statistics for vehicle uptake/replacement to forecast future transport emissions. We demonstrate that EVs, when compared to an efficient ICE, provide few benefits in terms of CO2 mitigation until 2030. However, between 2030 and 2050, predicted CO2 savings under the different EV uptake and decarbonisation scenarios begin to diverge with larger CO2 savings seen for the accelerated EV uptake. This work shows that simply focusing on on-road emissions is insufficient to model the future CO2 impact of transport. Instead a more complete production calculation must be combined with an EV uptake model. Using this extended model, our scenarios show how the lack of difference between a Business as Usual and accelerated EV uptake scenario can be explained by the time-lag in cause and effect between policy changes and the desired change in the vehicle fleet. Our work reveals that current UK policy is unlikely to achieve the desired reduction in transport-based CO2 by 2030. If embedded CO2 is included as part of the transport emissions sector, then all possible UK EV scenarios will miss the reduction target for 2050 unless this is combined with intense decarbonisation (80% of 1990 levels) of the UK electricity grid. This result highlights that whilst EVs offer an important contribution to decarbonisation in the transport sector it will be necessary to look at other transport mitigation strategies, such as modal shift to public transit, car sharing and demand management, to achieve both near-term and long-term mitigation targets.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d9", "source_url": "https://www.advent.energy/2019/02/01/htpem-methanol-fuel-cell-electric-car/", "snippet": "Methanol: the Surprising Solution for Pollution, Global Warming and ...

Furthermore, most Chinese manufacturers are fully committed to developing low-cost electric cars, and almost one in five cars sold in China by 2025 will be an EV. This S-curve rate of growth is going to disrupt the transportation and energy industries. These developments, coupled with a shared autonomous EV fleet model that is gaining traction and feasibility, will change our everyday lives and cities completely. Some futurists (6) predict that the change is going to be even more dramatic and all ICE cars will soon disappear from the roads, primarily because the cost of using a shared EV will be one-tenth of owning a vehicle. Unfortunately, the EV revolution will have minimal effect on the world climate and GHG emissions at least for the next two decades.

The Earth’s climate may have been at a tipping point at the end of Younger Dryas, possibly from the ice sheet discharge into the North Atlantic Ocean, enhanced snow cover and powerful volcanic eruptions that may have in combination led to intense Northern Hemisphere cooling, Forman said. “This period of rapid cooling coincides with the extinction of a number of species, including camels and horses, and the appearance of the Clovis archaeological tradition,” said Waters.

They both suggest that the crater formed around 58 million years ago, substantially pushing its age back.

Instead, the island would have been covered in large coniferous forests, with average temperatures of around 20â°C.Â On striking this area, the Hiawatha asteroid created a crater 31 kilometres wide and a kilometre deep.

The classic view of the Younger Dryas cooling interlude has been that an ice dam in the North American ice sheet ruptured, releasing a massive quantity of freshwater into the Atlantic Ocean. The sudden influx is thought to have shut down the ocean currents that move tropical water northward, resulting in the cold, dry climate of the Younger Dryas. But Sharma and his co-authors have discovered conclusive evidence linking an extraterrestrial impact with this environmental transformation.

The geochemistry and mineralogy profiles of the spherules are identical to rock found in southern Quebec, where Sharma and his colleagues argue the impact took place. \"We have for the first time narrowed down the region where a Younger Dryas impact did take place,\" says Sharma, \"even though we have not yet found its crater.\"", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d8", "source_url": "https://news.web.baylor.edu/news/story/2020/texas-cave-sediment-upends-meteorite-explanation-global-cooling", "snippet": "Texas Cave Sediment Upends Meteorite Explanation for Global ... The study indicates that the episode of cooling, scientifically known as the Younger Dryas, was caused by numerous coincident Earth-based processes, not an extraterrestrial impact. “The Younger Dryas, which occurred about 13,000 years ago, disrupted distinct warming at the end of the last ice age,” said co-author Steven Forman, Ph.D., professor of geosciences at Baylor University. The Earth’s climate may have been at a tipping point at the Younger Dryas, possibly from the ice sheet discharge into the North Atlantic Ocean, enhanced snow cover and powerful volcanic eruptions that may have in combination led to intense Northern Hemisphere cooling, Forman said. “This period of rapid cooling is associated with the extinction of a number of species, including mammoths and mastodons, and coincides with the appearance of early human occupants of the Clovis tradition,” said co-author Michael Waters, Ph.D., director of the Center for the First Americans at Texas A&M University. University of Houston scientists Brandon and doctoral candidate Nan Sun, lead author, accomplished the isotopic analysis of sediments collected from Hall’s Cave in the Texas Hill Country. The analysis focused on difficult measurements at the parts per trillion on osmium and levels of highly siderophile elements, which include rare elements like iridium, ruthenium, platinum, palladium and rhenium. The researchers determined the elements in the Texas sediments were not present in the correct relative proportions to have been added by a meteor or asteroid that impacted Earth. That meant the cooling could not have been caused by an extraterrestrial impact. It had to have been something happening on Earth. But what? “The signature from the osmium isotope analysis and the relative proportion of the elements matched that previously reported in volcanic gases,” Sun said. Kenneth Befus, Ph.D., volcanologist at Baylor University, added that “these signatures were likely the result of major eruptions across the Northern Hemisphere, including volcanoes in the Aleutians, Cascades and even Europe.” “I was skeptical.", "timestamp": ""}], "per_doc_notes": [{"doc_id": "d1", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "The snippet asserts that the Younger Dryas impact should be regarded as an observation, implying a meteor impact caused the Younger Dryas period.", "quote": "The Younger Dryas impact should no longer be viewed as a hypothesis but instead as an observation.", "verdict_reason": "It explicitly states the Younger Dryas impact is an observation, directly affirming a meteor impact caused the period.", "source_quality": "low"}, {"doc_id": "d2", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "A study found no evidence that a meteor impact caused the Younger Dryas period.", "quote": "“People get very excited about the idea of a major impact causing a catastrophic fire and the abrupt climate change in that period, but there just isn’t the evidence to support it,” said Andrew C.

This situation was to change later in the war when radio had proved to be the only reliable way to communicate, particularly when troops were on the move. The BF Trench Set One of the earliest radios to be used in the trenches was the 50-watt Trench Set, also known as the BF Set (Figure 2) which was used for communication from Brigade to Division. This went into action in the Battle of Loos in September 1915 and in the first Battle of the Somme on July 1st 1916. The transmitting portion of set was based on the design of the No 1 Aircraft Spark set. The receiving portion used a carborundum crystal detector. It was powered from an accumulator and also required dry-cell batteries for biasing the carborundum crystal and an internal test buzzer. Its range was 3.7km with aerials mounted on masts but this reduced to 1.1km when the aerial was run close to the ground. Careful planning of frequencies was required in order to minimize interference from neighbouring spark transmitters, a problem much simplified when CW sets came into use. The BF set was used extensively during the second half of the war and approximately 1200 were manufactured. 130-watt Wilson Trench Set & Short Wave Tuner Mk. III The Wilson Transmitter was used primarily for Division to Corps communication and Corps Directing Station. This set came into service about the same time as the BF Trench Set. It had a fixed spark gap with a motor-driven, high-speed interrupter rather than the slower magnetic interrupter. The greater number of sparks produced a musical note in the headphones, making the Morse signal more easy to hear through interference. The transmitter had the same frequencies as the BF set and the higher power meant that the range was up to 8.3km.

Credit: Scientific American Supplement, March 17, 1917 Advertisement Armies in the First World War were vast compared with armies in preceding wars. The telephone, telegraph and the appearance of effective wireless radio sets were replacing older communication methods. The article in Scientific American from March 17, 1917, says: “With an army strung out over miles of irregular trenches prompt communication by the older method is obviously impossible, although special instructions carried by fast motorcycles have been found greatly superior to the old horse-mounted messengers; but where rapid communication with the commanders of long lines of trenches, and numerous widely scattered batteries of guns, is necessary something vastly more prompt and certain is required, and in this emergency recourse is had to the telephone, which has proved to be indispensable. By means of telephones, operated through heavily insulated wires that can be run rapidly from point to point, resting directly upon the ground without any supports or elaborate fixtures, orders may be transmitted along miles of trenches within a few minutes, where flags could not be seen, and where messengers even on the fastest motorcycles would require hours, even if they got through safely at all, thus enabling rapid cooperative action to be taken, or special advances organized and properly supported both by troops and guns.” A German field telephone setup—portable of course—from 1914. Credit: Scientific American, December 19, 1914 Artillery, though, frequently cut telephone wires, so “runners” carrying messages back and forth were widely used. As warfare became more mobile late in the war, static telephone lines became less useful, while radios were becoming more portable.

Major T F Purves, commissioned officer in the Royal Engineers, worked with Post Office engineers to oversee the provision of over 200 items of special telecommunications apparatus. These were adapted to fit the needs of British soldiers in the trenches and ranged from modified cavalry field radios to field communication devices for gun spotters. This improved telecommunications equipment made it easier for troops and officers to get information up and down the chain of command; from forces headquarters to the front line and back. One important piece of apparatus for sending intelligence and operational updates was the portable morse code machine, used by the British army throughout the conflict and often in trench holes at the heart of the battle. During this period, work was also being done to improve the military’s ability to attack and defend. One of these techniques was sound ranging, a process that uses sound to work out the position and coordinates of enemy artillery firing – you can see the devices used to conduct experiments into sound ranging below in fascinating photographs from the Ministry of Aviation. Within a report held by BT Archives covering the Engineering Department’s work during the First World War, a letter written by General Douglas Haig, Commanding-in-Chief, British Armies in France, to Joseph Pease, Postmaster General, thanks officers for the great assistance provided in connection with sound ranging.

Vulnerable Communication on the Ground On the ground, signalers used a variety of devices and methods to send messages. Telephones were reliable, but their long, strung-out wires were vulnerable to shellfire and frequently cut. Burying the lines deep into the ground was labour intensive and time consuming, and still did not always protect against shellfire. Pigeons were surprisingly effective in carrying messages, but required special handlers and could become disoriented by the noise of artillery barrages. Bulky and Fragile Radios Wireless telegraphy (radio) could transmit Morse code in 1914, but the wireless sets were bulky and fragile, with relatively short ranges. Later, more robust wireless sets were used by observers to direct artillery fire. Limited Communication with Aircraft Aircraft flew “contact patrols” to observe the forward movement of troops. They were only fitted with transmitting wireless sets, as receivers added too much weight to the airframe. Aircraft could also drop messages near a headquarters or friendly position. Troops on the ground used various methods, such as signal lamps, panels, and flares, to send messages to aircraft. Unresolved Problems Despite these tools, communication often broke down between the attacking infantry and their headquarters in the rear. When this happened, commanders did not know the location of their troops and were unable to support them with accurate artillery fire, ammunition, or supplies.

Despite efforts to protect the wire lines, they were frequently cut at critical times as the result of the intense artillery fire. This led all the belligerents to develop and use radio (wireless) as an alternate means of communication. Prewar radio sets were too heavy and bulky to be taken into the trenches, and they also required large and highly visible aerials. Radio engineers of the belligerent nations soon developed smaller and more portable sets powered by storage batteries and using low, inconspicuous aerials. Although radio equipment came to be issued to the headquarters of all units, including battalions, the ease of enemy interception, the requirements for cryptographing or encoding messages, and the inherent unreliability of these early systems caused them to be regarded as strictly auxiliary to the wire system and reserved for emergency use when the wire lines were cut. Visual signaling returned to the battlefield in World War I with the use of electric signal lamps. Pyrotechnics, rockets, Very pistols, and flares had a wide use for transmitting prearranged signals. Messenger service came to be highly developed, and motorcycle, bicycle, and automobile messenger service was employed. Homing pigeons were used extensively as one-way messengers from front to rear and acquitted themselves extremely well. Dogs were also used as messengers and, in the German army, reached a high degree of efficiency. A new element in warfare, the airplane, introduced in World War I, immediately posed a problem in communication. During most of the war, communication between ground and air was difficult and elementary. To make his reports the pilot had to land or drop messages, and he received instructions while in the air from strips of white and black cloth called “panels” laid out in an open field according to prearranged designs.

The prewar radios used by the Signal Corps had been relatively high-powered sets designed for a large operating area; they were not meant to be used in the restricted conditions of trench warfare where their inability to be finely tuned caused them to interfere with the sets used by the Allies. Moreover, the spark-gap equipment weighed too much-up to 500 pounds-to be easily moved and often broke down. With the assistance of European radio experts, the Signal Corps developed its own models and had approximately twenty-five different types in production when the war ended. In the meantime, American forces used French radios. Despite some improvements, particularly in the production of vacuum tubes, \"radio carried little of the war's communications load,\" a fact that had a direct impact on the battlefield.96 The high combat casualty rates of World War I can partly be attributed to the lack of a reliable wireless communications system. Once soldiers went \"over the top,\" they found themselves isolated. During deafening artillery barrages a commander could not control his men with his voice, and vision became limited amid the fog of battle. In order to maintain contact, troops tended to move in groups that made them easy targets for enemy machine gunners. Although wire lines were portable, they could not last long under constant and withering artillery bombardment that chewed them to bits; what the shellfire spared often fell victim to the treads of tanks or other vehicles.

George Canning, who is usually thought to hold the record, served for 119 days in 1827 until his death from tuberculosis. Truss had an eventful time in charge. Just days after she took office, Queen Elizabeth II died after 70 years on the throne. Truss presided over a national mourning period, speaking at the late monarch's funeral, and she traveled the nation with the new King Charles III. Soon afterward, Truss launched a \"mini-budget\" with her finance minister at the time, Kwasi Kwarteng. The plan would lower income taxes for the highest earners and cut some other taxes, while increasing spending. This upset the markets, as investors felt the plans weren't credible, and it forced several U-turns after just a few days. First Kwarteng was forced out, and now Truss has been defenestrated.

LONDON -- It took Liz Truss 12 years in Parliament to reach the pinnacle of British political power. Now, after just 44 days leading the country, she has assumed the title of shortest-serving prime minister in the history of the United Kingdom. Not since George Canning -- who served almost three times as long as Truss at 119 days -- in 1827 has a British prime minister served such a short period of time. He died of tuberculosis while in office. The blistering speed of the collapse of Truss' period in governance is unparalleled in modern times.

Liz Truss Is Now the Shortest-Serving Prime Minister in U.K. History In the end, an iceberg lettuce won. A popular video livestream launched by The Daily Star on Oct. 14 of who would outlast each other, a wilting vegetable, or Prime Minister Liz Truss, had gripped the nation and underscored the chaos at the heart of Britain’s government. Truss announced her resignation Thursday after just 44 days in office. She was the third Prime Minister this year and quickly lost favor with fellow Conservatives and the wider public following a disastrous “mini budget” on Sept. 23 that spooked markets, sent borrowing rates up, and tanked the British pound. She fired her finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng and replaced him with Jeremy Hunt in the wake of the fallout, but it was not enough to ensure her political survival. Truss will remain in office until a new Conservative Party leader is chosen via a leadership contest, which is expected to conclude on Oct. 28. Nevertheless, Truss’s brief stint has earned her an unfortunate place in history as Britain’s shortest-serving Prime Minister. The last record-holder, George Canning, who held office almost 200 years ago, saw his time in office cut short when he died of poor health—reports say tuberculosis or pneumonia. While Truss is, by a long stretch, the shortest-serving leader, here are the five former prime ministers who sit behind her—all of whom served a century or more ago. George Canning: 119 days Before Truss, George Canning held the title of shortest-serving Prime Minister. Canning was a member of the Tory party who started his political career as Foreign Secretary under the Duke of Portland but resigned after dueling with the war minister at the time.

Rishi Sunak's tenure as Prime Minister lasted less than two years. But what about the other side? Those PMs at the opposite end of the spectrum whose time at the top wasn’t illustrious or nearly as extensive? Let’s take a closer look at nine unfortunate leaders from modern history whose names entered the record books for all the wrong reasons. 1. Liz Truss - 44 days Image: Fred Duval / Shutterstock.com Liz Truss is the shortest-serving Prime Minister in British history, a title previously claimed by George Canning, who died in 1827 after five months in office. Truss was selected as Conservative Party leader in September 2022, after a six-week leadership contest, that was brought about by the resignation of Boris Johnson, another PM who didn't serve out their full term. The start of Truss' tenure was overshadowed by the death of Queen Elizabeth II and the period of national mourning that followed. Truss' low tax/ high-growth policies helped her win the Conservative Party leadership contest, but spooked the market and precipitated a financial crisis. Forced to sack her Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, and abandon the policies that he announced at the disastrous mini-budget, Truss' credibility lay in tatters. With her authority dwindling, she resigned as party leader on 20th October 2022 following mounting pressure from her fellow Conservative MPs to stand down. 2.

Children and adolescents need more sleep than adults. Interestingly, older adults need about the same amount of sleep as younger adults — seven or more hours of sleep per night. Unfortunately, many older adults often get less sleep than they need. One reason is that they often have more trouble falling asleep. A study of adults over 65 found that 13 percent of men and 36 percent of women take more than 30 minutes to fall asleep. Also, older people often sleep less deeply and wake up more often throughout the night, which may be why they may nap more often during the daytime. Nighttime sleep schedules may change with age too. Many older adults tend to get sleepier earlier in the evening and awaken earlier in the morning. There are many possible explanations for these changes. Older adults may produce and secrete less melatonin, the hormone that promotes sleep. They may also be more sensitive to — and may awaken because of — changes in their environment, such as noise. Older adults may also have other medical and psychiatric problems that can affect their nighttime sleep. Researchers have noted that people without major medical or psychiatric illnesses report better sleep. Not sleeping well can lead to a number of problems. Older adults who have poor nighttime sleep are more likely to have a depressed mood, attention and memory problems, excessive daytime sleepiness, more nighttime falls, and use more over-the-counter or prescription sleep aids. Poor sleep is also associated with a poorer quality of life. Many people believe that poor sleep is a normal part of aging, but it is not. In fact, many healthy older adults report few or no sleep problems. Sleep patterns change as we age, but disturbed sleep and waking up tired every day are not part of normal aging.

Contrary to popular opinion, older people don't need less sleep than the average person. In fact, adults require about the same amount of sleep from their 20s into old age, although the number of hours per night varies from person to person. But many older adults get much less sleep than they need, for a variety of reasons. Â Sleep problems and seniors Harry Gaertner, aÂ retiree from Richardson, Texas, remembers first being extremely tired and having difficulty sleeping six years ago. \"I had to have 10 hours of sleep and an hour nap every day,\" he recalls. Gaertner's wife also noticed he was snoring heavily. A trip to the doctor resulted in a sleep apnea diagnosis and a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine. But Gaertner says, \"the machine didn't work, so that meant something else was wrong. \" A trip to the ER revealed what that something else was: Gaertner needed a pacemaker to correct his heart rhythm. He now has a guaranteed pulse of 60 beats per minute, which helps him sleep and breathe easier. But Gaertner's heart issues were only partially to blame for his restless nights. He still suffered from sleep apnea, so he resumed use of the CPAP machine and now dozes more comfortably than he has in years. Many seniors donât get enough sleep because of insomnia. It can be just as debilitating as the poor sleep that comes with sleep apnea. \"Insomnia is more common for seniors, partly because of health issues, partly because of the anxiety and the concerns of aging, and sometimes because of medication,\" says Jack Gardner, MD, a neurologist certified in sleep medicine at Baylor Scott & White Medical Center in Waxahachie, Texas. Gardner adds that the likelihood of sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome also increases with age.

Many studies — often funded by the pharmaceutical industry — have suggested that we're all sleep-deprived zombies, risking our health for lack of shut-eye. But new research in the U.K. confirms previous indications that older people need less sleep. It also suggests that variations in sleep hours needed are normal and healthy — so long as one is not overly sleepy during the day. \"Healthy aging appears to be associated with reductions in the sleep duration and depth required to maintain daytime alertness,\" the scientists said in a statement. Still, researchers warn that many people in modern society suffer from sleep deprivation, and that it can lead to plenty of woes from accidents on the job to higher risk of falls and even death in elderly people. The study, announced today, involved 110 healthy adults who did not have any sleep disorders and didn't complain about lack of sleep. They went through various rounds of sleep and wake periods under varying conditions, and were tested for sleepiness during the wake periods. During the first night with eight hours in bed, the resulting average sleep time, by age group: The researchers do not suggest that these times, achieved during lab conditions much different from real life, are normal. But the comparison between groups is what's interesting, with the oldest group snoozing about 20 minutes less than the middle-agers, who in turn slept about 23 minutes less than the youngest group. The amount of time spent in deep sleep, measured as \"slow-wave sleep,\" was also less in the older groups.

As a kid, you needed 9-12 hours each night, as a teenager you needed 8-10, and then as an adult, you needed 7-9 hours. A few sleep changes you may experience as you continue to age include: According to a study published by the Sleep Medicine Clinics, healthy older adults are actually less likely to report sleep problems, but the causes of their sleep problems are created by multiple factors, like: These changes occur naturally as you age. However, your brain’s natural aging can end up hurting your sleep quality also. An aging Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN)— the part of the brain that regulates your circadian rhythm and sleep-wake cycle— can disrupt your sleep cycle and affect your ability to get the healthy sleep you need as you get older.

Common sleep problems related to dementia Many older adults have problems sleeping, but people with dementia often have an even harder time. Sleep disturbance may affect up to 25% of people with mild to moderate dementia and 50% of people with severe dementia. Sleep disturbances tend to get worse as dementia progresses in severity. Possible sleep problems include excessive sleepiness during the day and insomnia with difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep. Frequent awakenings during the night and premature morning awakenings are also common. People with dementia might also experience a phenomenon in the evening or during the night called sundowning. They might feel confused, agitated, anxious and aggressive. Night wandering in this state of mind can be unsafe. Obstructive sleep apnea is also more common in people with Alzheimer's disease. This potentially serious sleep disorder causes breathing to repeatedly stop and start during sleep. Factors that might contribute to sleep disturbances and sundowning include: Mental and physical exhaustion at the end of the day Changes in the body clock A need for less sleep, which is common among older adults Disorientation Reduced lighting and increased shadows, which can cause people with dementia to become confused and afraid Supporting a good night's sleep Sleep disturbances can take a toll on both you and the person with dementia.

Absolutely. Not getting enough sleep or poor-quality sleep can increase risk for mental health disorders. While insomnia can be a symptom of psychiatric disorders, like anxiety and depression, it is now recognized that sleep problems can also contribute to the onset and worsening of different mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, and even suicidal ideation. Sleep deprivation studies show that otherwise healthy people can experience increased anxiety and distress levels following poor sleep. Those with mental health disorders are even more likely to experience chronic sleep problems and, in turn, these sleep problems are likely to exacerbate psychiatric symptoms and even increase risk for suicide. The good news is that there are ways to improve sleep quality and quantity, so identifying and addressing sleep problems is critical to alleviating the severity of psychiatric disorders.

The annual campaign begins at the start of Daylight Savings Time, when Americans lose an hour of sleep. Do individuals vary on the amount of sleep they need? Are there really larks and owls? The amount of sleep individual’s need in part depends on their age. In general, children and teens need more sleep than adults. While there are certainly individual differences in the amount of sleep each adult needs, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends that adults sleep at least 7 hours on a regular basis to promote optimal health and functioning, with most adults needing somewhere between 7-9 hours. Teens typically need 8-10 hours and older adults (65 years and older) between 7-8 hours. Although the amount of sleep we get is important, good quality sleep is also essential.

[1, 2]. Estimates of the prevalence of insomnia are variable in the literature because of inconsistency in definitions used and limitations in accurately estimating incidence and remission rate of insomnia [3]. The prevalence of insomnia, in older adults, is estimated to be between 13 and 47% [3]. The high prevalence of insomnia in older adults can be explained by sleep pattern changes that occur with age. As people age, their total sleep time (TST) decreases [4, 5], their sleep efficiency worsens, and they wake up more frequently than younger people [4, 6, 7]. Due to physiological changes that occur with age, older adults require less sleep time at night than younger adults. According to the National Sleep Foundation’s sleep time duration recommendations, sleeping 7–9 h per night for adults and 7–8 h per night for older adults is appropriate [8]. It has been shown that both short or long sleep duration (≤6 or ≥ 9 h per night) could have negative health outcome [9,10,11]. In a systematic review with meta-analysis sleep duration (both short and long) was associated with all-cause mortality [12]. Treating insomnia in older adults is a clinical challenge. Before starting treatment for insomnia, it is crucial to identify clinical insomnia from typical age-related sleep pattern changes [13]. If clinical insomnia is detected, it is important to rule out secondary causes of insomnia such as psychiatric illness or other medical conditions and treat accordingly. For primary clinical insomnia, non-pharmacologic treatments are recommended to be tried first [14,15,16]. For example, multicomponent cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi) is effective when delivered in primary care and has successfully treated insomnia in older adults [14,15,16,17].

Upon the retirement of a prime minister who is Scottish, it is likely that the primarily Scottish honour of Knight of the Thistle (KT) will be used instead of the Order of the Garter, which is generally regarded as an English honour.[n 4] Historically it has also been common to grant prime ministers a peerage upon retirement from the Commons, elevating the individual to the Lords. Formerly, the peerage bestowed was usually an earldom.[n 5] The last such creation was for Harold Macmillan, who resigned in 1963. Unusually, he became Earl of Stockton only in 1984, over twenty years after leaving office. The most recent former prime minister to die was Margaret Thatcher (1979–1990) on 8 April 2013. Her death meant that for the first time since 1955 (the year in which the Earldom of Attlee was created, subsequent to the death of Earl Baldwin in 1947) the membership of the House of Lords included no former prime minister, a situation which remained the case until David Cameron was appointed to the House in November 2023.

It depends on their personal choice and reasons surrounding the need to take on such positions.

Prime Ministers Lord Bute and Lord Rosebery were among the wealthiest men in the country during their retirements and are often touted as some of the wealthiest to serve as in office.

The last Liberal Party Prime Minister was David Lloyd George (1863-1945), who left office in October 1922. There has not been a Liberal government since. However, a brief ‘Lib-Lab Pact’ was formed in 1977-78 during the minority Labour government of Jim Callaghan. Also, under the leadership of Nick Clegg (b 1967), the by then renamed Liberal Democrats formed a coalition government with the Conservatives from 2010-15. Liberal politicians also supported national and wartime coalitions from 1937-45. Since 1922, there have been fifteen Conservative Prime Ministers and seven Labour (including Kier Starmer).

The maximum amount which may be claimed per year is £115,000, plus 10% towards any staff pension costs. This limit is reviewed annually, and at the start of each Parliament, by the current prime minister. The maximum level may be adjusted downwards if the former prime minister receives any public funds for fulfilling other public appointments.[130] Downing Street confirmed in November 2023 that former prime minister David Cameron would not claim from the PDCA while he acted as Foreign Secretary.[131] Notes ^The Sovereign's prerogative powers are sometimes called reserve powers. They include the sole authority to dismiss a prime minister and government of the day in extremely rare and exceptional circumstances, and other powers such as withholding Royal Assent, and summoning and proroguing Parliament. These reserve powers can be exercised without the consent of Parliament. While formally discretionary, the exercise of these powers is heavily limited by convention. ^During the history of the modern office, five men have served as Prime Minister in both the House of Commons and House of Lords; four moved from serving in the Commons to accept a peerage, while the fifth disclaimed his peerage after his appointment and contested a by-election to become an MP. ^This circumstance is somewhat confused, however, as since the Great Reform Act 1832, only seven Scots have served as prime minister. Of these, two – Bonar Law and Ramsay MacDonald – died while still sitting in the Commons, not yet having retired; MacDonald was offered the KT in 1935, but declined it as acceptance would have conflicted with his principles as a Labour Party member.[113] The Earl of Aberdeen was appointed to both the Order of the Garter and the Order of the Thistle, while Alec Douglas-Home became a KT while Foreign Secretary. Yet another, Arthur Balfour, was appointed to the Order of the Garter, but represented an English constituency and may not have considered himself entirely Scottish; of the remaining two, the Earl of Rosebery became a KG, and Gordon Brown remained in the House of Commons as a backbencher until 2015. ^", "timestamp": "2025-01-05"}, {"doc_id": "d2", "source_url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/prime-minister", "snippet": "Prime Minister - GOV.UK Current role holder.

Experts analyze the implications for the country's politics. Labour leader Keir Starmer put his message of ‘change’ front and center of his campaign at the U.K. general election. Press Association via AP Images LONDON — Change — the single word written on every Labour Party general election campaign flier, poster and leaflet. And the British electorate delivered, ushering in a seismic change. But despite voters handing the new U.K. prime minister, Keir Starmer, a landslide victory, there was no stampede of support for him and his outfit. In the 2019 general election, Labour recorded its worst performance since 1935, picking up 202 seats in the House of Commons legislature off the back of a 32.1% national vote share. In Thursday’s general election, the party won 412 out of 650 seats — a majority of 170 — having secured a vote share of 33.7%, which was just 1.7 percentage points higher than its showing five years ago. So how has Starmer ended up ousting Rishi Sunak, his Conservative Party rival, from 10 Downing Street on such small gains? Josephine Harmon, an assistant professor of political science at Northeastern University in London, says British voters elected a Labour government for the first time in almost 20 years for pragmatic reasons. ‘Landslide that was won with a glum’ “Interestingly, this is a Labour landslide that was not won with a kind of euphoria like Tony Blair’s 1997 election,” she says. “This was a landslide that was won with a glum, orderly sense of pragmatism from the British public who were voting in their interests. “They were saying in focus groups, ‘I’m not crazy about Starmer but it is better than the alternative.’ But usually that isn’t enough to get you a landslide.” Labour was aided by a collapse in support in Scotland for the Scottish National Party and voters turning away from the Tories in England and parts of Wales.", "timestamp": "2024-07-05"}, {"doc_id": "d5", "source_url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/prime-ministers-office-10-downing-street", "snippet": "Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street - GOV.UK Meet the Prime Minister.

He promised what he called a big reset after 14 sometimes turbulent years of Conservative government. The defeated Conservatives are looking for a new leader after Rishi Sunak resigned as he left office. Special correspondent Malcolm Brabant reports from London. (Cheering and applause) Malcolm Brabant: Seconds after voting ended, exit polls confirmed that Sir Keir Starmer had led the Labor Party to one of its greatest ever parliamentary victories and that he was heading to 10 Downing Street. Keir Starmer, British Prime Minister: People here and around the country have spoken, and they're ready for change, to end the politics of performance, a return to politics as public service. Malcolm Brabant: This was the worst election result in the Conservative Party's history. Rishi Sunak, Britain's first prime minister of color, managed to hang on to his district in Northern England, while many of his colleagues were wiped out. After 14 years of Conservatism ended, with most people being poorer, voters took their revenge. But Sunak was dignified in defeat.

A scholar par excellence, he earned great powers through the performance of tapasya, which in turn, earned him great name and fame amongst his fellow rishis. He is best known for being the father of the primary antagonist of the Ramayana, Ravana.[1] Legend Birth The birth of Vishrava is described in the Ramayana. Once, the great sage Pulastya has engaged in austerities in the ashrama of Trinabindu, on the slopes of Mount Meru. Even as he was engaged in a penance in solitude, he was disturbed by a number of youthful maidens, the daughters of other sages, pannagas, as well as apsaras. They played their musical instruments and danced, seeking to divert his attention. Enraged, Pulastya declared that she among them who fell under his gaze would instantly conceive. Terrified of the Brahmin's curse, the girls vanished. During this moment, Manini, the daughter of Trinabindu,[2] who had not been present when the curse was invoked, wandered near the sage, searching for her friends. She found herself pregnant, and rushed to report her condition to her father. The sage Trinabindu requested Pulastya to marry his daughter, and the latter agreed, and so the two lived together in the ashrama. Pleased with his wife's virtuous conduct, Pulastya declared that their child would inherit her virtue, and would be named Vishrava.[3] Children Vishrava grew to become a great sage, devoted to the study of the Vedas, and detached from earthly pleasures.

If one cares to dig deep, there’s an interesting story at each and every step. Ravana played the role of a villain, but why did he play this role is a question of great importance. It was actually to bring an equilibrium to the equation of good and evil. No wonder he is still worshiped in some parts of the world. Ravana was the grandson of Pulastya, one of the greatest sages of Indian mythology and one of the Saptarishis. He was born to Sage Vishravan and Asura’s mother Kaikashi. Hence he is considered half Asur (demon) and half Brahmin (sage). Ravana is known as the supreme antagonist in the ancient Hindu epic Ramayana. He is depicted as a Rakshasa (demon) and the great king of Lanka. He is known as a demon with ten heads, but not many people know that he was not born with ten heads. Ravana actually was a great follower of Lord Shiva, an inordinate scholar, an excellent ruler, and the maestro of the veena (plucked string instrument). He had written two books: the Ravana Samhita (a book of astrology) and Arka Prakasham (book of Siddha medicine). He was well versed in Ayurveda and dark practices of black magic. It is said that he could control the planetary positions at his will. He owned pushpakviman (a flying chariot) which he won from his step brother Kuber. He had mastered tantra vidya (science of creating optical illusions of thoughts) which he used in battles against his enemies. Once when Ravana tried to lift Mount Kailash, Lord Shiva crushed his forehand beneath the mountain and then Ravana starting chanting praise of Lord Shiva and asked for forgiveness. Lord Shiva was so pleased with Ravana that he stated dancing with all fury and passion and this dance is called tandav and the chants came to be known as “The Shiva Tandav Strotram”.", "timestamp": "2022-04-06"}], "per_doc_notes": [{"doc_id": "d1", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "Ravana's father is Vishrava.", "quote": "Ravana - Wikipedia Ravana ; Vishrava (father); Kaikasi (mother)", "verdict_reason": "The snippet explicitly names Vishrava as Ravana’s father, directly answering the query.", "source_quality": "high"}, {"doc_id": "d2", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "Ravana's father was the sage Visravas.", "quote": "His father was the sage Visravas, one of Brahma's ten mind-born sons, who was ...", "verdict_reason": "The snippet explicitly names Visravas as Ravana’s father, directly answering the query.", "source_quality": "low"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "Ravana's father was named Vishrava.", "quote": "The father of King Ravana was named Vishrava.", "verdict_reason": "The snippet explicitly names Vishrava as Ravana’s father, directly answering the query.", "source_quality": "low"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "Ravana's father is Vishrava.", "quote": "Ravana's father, Vishrava, was the son of Pulatsya, the brother of celebrated sage Agastya Muni and the grandson of Brahma, the Creator,", "verdict_reason": "The snippet explicitly names Vishrava as Ravana's father, directly answering the query.", "source_quality": "low"}, {"doc_id": "d5", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "Vishrava is described as the father of Ravana.", "quote": "He is best known for being the father of the primary antagonist of the Ramayana, Ravana.", "verdict_reason": "The snippet explicitly identifies Vishrava as Ravana’s father, directly answering the query.", "source_quality": "high"}, {"doc_id": "d6", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "Ravana is the son of the sage Vishrava and Kaikesi.", "quote": "He is the son of the great sage Vishrava and Kaikesi.", "verdict_reason": "The snippet explicitly names Vishrava as Ravana’s father, directly answering the query.", "source_quality": "low"}, {"doc_id": "d7", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "Vishrava is identified as Ravana's father.", "quote": "Who Was Vishrava? | Ravana's Father | Stories Of Ramayana", "verdict_reason": "The snippet explicitly identifies Vishrava as Ravana’s father, directly answering the query.", "source_quality": "low"}, {"doc_id": "d8", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "Ravana's father was Vishrava.", "quote": "Ravan's parents were Vishrava (son of Pulatsya) and Kaikasi (daughter of Sumali & Tadaka)", "verdict_reason": "The snippet explicitly names Vishrava as Ravana’s father, directly answering the query.", "source_quality": "low"}, {"doc_id": "d9", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "Ravana's father was Sage Vishravan.", "quote": "He was born to Sage Vishravan and Asura's mother Kaikashi.", "verdict_reason": "The snippet explicitly names Sage Vishravan as Ravana’s father, directly answering the query.", "source_quality": "low"}], "conflict_reason": "All documents (d1–d9) consistently identify Vishrava—spelled variably as Vishrava, Visravas, or Vishravan—as Ravana’s father, showing uniform agreement with only minor transliteration differences, hence no factual or interpretive conflict exists.", "answerable_under_evidence": true, "expected_response": {"answer": "Multiple sources consistently identify Vishrava as the father of Ravana [d1][d5].

Basil Davidson, one of the most noted historians recognized and declared that there were no lands at that time (the eighth century) “more admired by its neighbours, or more comfortable to live in, than a rich African civilization which took shape in Spain” 5. At its height, Córdova, the heart of Moorish territory in Spain, was the most modern city in Europe. The streets were well-paved, with raised sidewalks for pedestrians. During the night, ten miles of streets were well illuminated by lamps. (This was hundreds of years before there was a paved street in Paris or a street lamp in London.)

Textbooks place more emphasis on a triumphant “reconquest” of the territory by Christian rulers, aided by crusaders, that ended in the 13th century. Since then, Portuguese identity has been constructed in opposition to the Moors, historically depicted as enemies. But not everyone agrees with this version of history. “A great part of the population converted to Islam,” explains Filomena Barros, a professor of Medieval History at the University of Evora. Research has suggested that by the 10th century, half the population of the Iberian peninsula was Muslim. For Barros, Muslims who sailed from North Africa were no more foreign than the Christian kings and armies from northern Europe who conquered the territory before and after them. “The Iberian Peninsula kept being conquered,” she says. “It’s interesting we don’t talk about the Roman conquest, or the Visigothic conquest, but we always talk about the Islamic conquest.” Before Muslim armies arrived, the region was ruled by Visigoths, a Germanic people who ruled between 418 and 711. Traces of Portugal’s Islamic past can still be found [Marta Vidal/Al Jazeera] History textbooks emphasise the battles fought by Christian rulers against Muslim ones, but the defeat of Muslim armies did not mean an end to the Muslim presence in Portugal. “The Christian reconquest doesn’t mean Muslims go back to their land, because this land was theirs as well,” says the historian. Today, however, less than 0.5 percent of the population of 11 million is Muslim, and few are aware that Muslims once made up a much larger proportion of the population.

With the dual drive of territorial acquisition and Islamic expansion, the Moors saw the fertile and resource-rich Iberian Peninsula as a lucrative conquest, offering control over key trade routes and the opportunity to spread Islamic culture and knowledge. The Moors weren't all work and no play, though. Their ingenious architects created some of Europe's most awe-inspiring monuments, including the Alhambra in Granada and the Great Mosque of Córdoba. Farewell to the Moors All good things must come to an end, and so it was with the Moors in Andalucia. The fall of Granada in 1492 is not merely a historical footnote, but a monumental event that ended an era and began a new chapter in Spanish history. As the last stronghold of the Moors in Spain, Granada's surrender to the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, brought the nearly 800-year period of Islamic rule in the Iberian Peninsula to a close. The Christian forces, driven by religious zeal and the promise of territorial expansion, methodically wore down the resistance of the Nasrid dynasty ruling Granada. Boabdil, the last Muslim king, was faced with internal strife, dwindling resources, and relentless pressure from the Catholic forces. This significant event concluded a lengthy military campaign and symbolized a turning point in Spanish history. The victory led to the unification of Spain under Catholic rule, setting the stage for the Spanish Inquisition and the Age of Exploration. Granada's legacy, encapsulated in the stunning Alhambra, continues to resonate as a symbol of a complex and rich cultural era. The Moors may have left, but their influence remained. They left behind a rich cultural heritage, and perhaps, a lasting appreciation for the finer things in life. From the zest of the Andalusian music to the flair of its architecture, the Moorish influence continues to resonate. What did the Moors Ever do for Spain?

One such influential culture that left an indelible mark on the country is that of the Moors. The Moors, an Islamic civilization, arrived in Portugal in the 8th century and their presence lasted for over four centuries. In this article, I'll delve lightly into the historical background of the Moors in Portugal, explore their cultural contributions, and uncover the lasting legacy they left behind. Historical Background of the Moors in Portugal To understand the impact of the Moors in Portugal, we must first delve into their historical background. The Moors were a Muslim people of Berber and Arab descent who originated from North Africa. They quickly expanded their empire across North Africa and into the Iberian Peninsula, which includes present-day Portugal and Spain. In 711 AD, the Moors crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and established their presence in the region. The Moors settled in different parts of the country, with the Algarve region (from the Arabic: Al-Gharb, meaning 'the West') and the city of Silves being of particular importance. Silves, in its Moorish heyday, was a center of culture, knowledge, and commerce, complete with bustling markets, palatial homes, and flowing fountains. Arrival and Expansion of the Moors in Portugal The arrival of the Moors in Portugal marked the beginning of a new era. They quickly established themselves in various regions, including Lisbon, Santarém, and Mértola. These cities became centers of trade, commerce, and learning under Moorish rule. Their influence was strongest in the Alentejo and Algarve regions of southern Portugal. The Moors brought with them advanced agricultural techniques, scientific knowledge, and architectural marvels that transformed the landscape of Portugal. Influence of the Moors in Portugal The influence of the Moors on Portuguese culture and architecture is undeniable.

Both Mūsā and Ṭāriq were recalled to Syria by the caliph, and they departed in 714 at the end of the summer; by then most of the Iberian Peninsula was under Muslim control. The rapid success of the Islamic forces can be explained by the fact that Hispano-Visigoth society had not yet succeeded in achieving a compact and homogeneousintegration. The Jews, harassed by the legal ordinances of Toledo, were particularly hostile toward the Christian government. Moreover, the Muslim conquest brought advantages to many elements of society: the burden of taxes was generally less onerous than it had been in the last years of the Visigoth epoch; serfs who converted to Islam (mawālī; singular: mawlā) advanced into the category of freedmen and enrolled among the dependents of some conquering noble; and Jews, who were no longer persecuted, were placed on an equal footing with the Hispano-Romans and Goths who still remained within the Christian fold. Thus, in the first half of the 8th century, a new society developed in Muslim Spain. The Arabs were the ruling element; a distinction was made between baladiyyūn (i.e., Arabs who had entered Spain in 712 under Mūsā) and Syrians (who arrived in 740 under Balj ibn Bishr). Below them in status were the Imazighen, who made up the majority of the invading troops, whose numbers and influence continued to grow over the course of centuries because of their steady influx from Africa. Then came the native population who had converted to Islam, the musālimah, and their descendants, the muwallads; many of them were also mawālī (i.e., connected by patronage with an Arab) or even themselves of Amazigh lineage. This group formed the majority of the population because during the first three centuries social and economic motives induced a considerable number of natives to convert to Islam.

The Granadine Moors were forced to pay to Castile a sizable annual tribute, but Moorish culture experienced something of a rebirth in Christian Spain. In Toledo, a Castilian city already famous throughout Europe as a crossroads of Christian, Arab, and Jewish thought, Alfonso X established the Escuela de Traductores (School of Translators), an institution that made Arabic works available to the Christian West. During the same period, James I of Aragon completed Aragon’s part in the Reconquest. After occupying the Balearics (1235), he captured Valencia (1238). Unlike Ferdinand, James carefully worked to preserve the agricultural economy of the Moors and so established the final peninsular frontiers of Aragon.

Best time to visit Andalusia Andalusia is a year-round destination, though it can get exceptionally hot and dry in July and August. The weather is cooler and while it is the driest part of Spain there is some chance of rain from December to March. I think the best time to go is in May, when you can enjoy the Festival of the Courtyards and the gardens in bloom, but September and October also bring more comfortable weather, clear skies and fewer crowds. Andalusia’s Moorish history The Moorish-built Torre del Oro (Golden Tower), Seville In 711 AD, North African Muslims invaded Andalusia, ushering in seven centuries of Muslim rule on the Iberian Peninsula. We say ‘the Moors’, but that’s an imprecise term that lumps together disparate factions from North Africa, including the Umayyads, Almohads and Nasrids. These rulers brought with them a sophisticated culture that prized tolerance and scientific learning, something of a contrast to the rest of Europe during the Middle Ages. Scholars and engineers flourished across the peninsula, especially in Al-Andalus, as the southern region was known. Here, Muslims, Christians and Jews all lived and worked side by side. Almost immediately after the Moorish armies invaded, Christian forces tried to drive them out — a long, uneven process called the Reconquista.", "timestamp": ""}], "per_doc_notes": [{"doc_id": "d1", "verdict": "partially supports", "key_fact": "The snippet states that the Spanish occupation by the Moors began in 711 AD but does not mention when the Spaniards and Portuguese drove them out.", "quote": "The Spanish occupation by the Moors began in 711 AD when an African army, under their leader Tariq ibn-Ziyad, crossed the Strait of Gibraltar from northern Africa and invaded the Iberian peninsula ‘Andalus’.", "verdict_reason": "It provides the start year of Moorish rule but not the year of their expulsion, so the answer is incomplete.", "source_quality": "low"}, {"doc_id": "d2", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "The Christian reconquest that expelled Muslim rulers from Portugal ended in the 13th century.", "quote": "Textbooks place more emphasis on a triumphant “reconquest” of the territory by Christian rulers, aided by crusaders, that ended in the 13th century.", "verdict_reason": "The snippet explicitly states that the Christian reconquest ended in the 13th century, directly answering when the Moors were driven out.", "source_quality": "high"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "The fall of Granada in 1492 ended Moorish rule in Spain.", "quote": "The fall of Granada in 1492 is not merely a historical footnote, but a monumental event that ended an era and began a new chapter in Spanish history.", "verdict_reason": "Explicitly states that Moorish rule ended in 1492, directly answering the query about when the Spaniards and Portuguese drove out the Moors.", "source_quality": "low"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "verdict": "partially supports", "key_fact": "In 1139, Afonso declared himself King Afonso I of Portugal, beginning the process of driving the Moors out of Portugal.", "quote": "In 1139, after a victorious battle, Afonso declared himself King Afonso I of Portugal, and thus began the slow process of driving the Moors out of Portugal.", "verdict_reason": "Provides a year and event related to expelling the Moors in Portugal but does not mention Spain or the complete expulsion, so only partial support.", "source_quality": "low"}, {"doc_id": "d5", "verdict": "irrelevant", "key_fact": "", "quote": "", "verdict_reason": "The snippet discusses the early Muslim conquest and social structure in Spain but does not mention when the Spaniards and Portuguese expelled the Moors.", "source_quality": "high"}, {"doc_id": "d6", "verdict": "partially supports", "key_fact": "The snippet mentions events in 1492, 1502, and 1526 related to the expulsion or conversion of Jews and Moors but does not specify when the Spaniards and Portuguese drove out the Arabic Moors.", "quote": "On 30 July 1492, all the Jewish community—some 200,000 people—were forcibly expelled.[123] ...

How serious does an argument about the proper way to form a past tense of a verb have to be for a bunch of lawyers to get involved? Not too serious, apparently, although the argument in question is a very heated one, and it shows no signs of cooling down. The word at the heart of all this controversy is the past tense of the verb “to plead,” which comes in two forms—pleaded and pled. And both of them are correct. Sort of. Plead definition and examples There are three major ways you can use the verb plead (pronounced PLEED): 1 To say that someone is making a serious and emotional appeal: “Everything that is right or reasonable pleads for separation. The blood of the slain, the weeping voice of nature cries, ’tis time to part. —Thomas Paine, Common Sense and Other Writings 2 To say that someone is arguing a case, usually in front of a court: “The development leaves no room for the victims to plead a case in a court of law.” —The Guardian 3 To say that someone is making a plea in court regarding their guilt or innocence: “Anibangel Molina, a Venezuelan businessman accused of defrauding dozens of investors, intends to plead guilty in the case later this month, according to Miami federal court records.” —Miami Herald Pled and pleaded If you were to look up examples of what the past tense of the verb plead is, you’d see that there are two forms you can use: pleaded and pled.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d2", "source_url": "https://grammarist.com/usage/pleaded-pled/", "snippet": "Pleaded or Pled - Definition & Examples But both forms are considered acceptable in modern English. Many people think that pled is the preferred term in the UK, but that’s not the case. Both are right; both are used in America, Canada, and the UK. However, Australia seems to have a hat-on for the spelling pled, so use pleaded if you’re writing for an Aussie audience. What Is the Past Tense of Plead? As I’ve already mentioned, the past tense of “plead” can be either “pleaded” or “pled.” Like someone could have pleaded/pled with the judge for mercy. See how both forms are used interchangeably? Neither is considered incorrect. Is It Pled Guilty or Plead Guilty? When we think of pleading guilty, we’ll see “pleaded” more commonly used than the variant “pled.” But, again, you can use either form if you want. They pleaded guilty, or they pled guilty; it doesn’t matter. Pleaded Synonyms There are several other synonyms you can use to express a similar meaning as pleaded. Begged Implored Beseeched Entreated Petitioned Appealed Importuned Pleaded Pronunciation “Pleaded” is pronounced as plee-did, and you’d say “pled” as pled with a shorter “e” sound. Sentence Examples Using Pleaded I was blown away when the defendant pleaded guilty to the charges. Yes, I pleaded with my son to clean up his room, but he still didn’t listen. James pleaded for help, but no one rescued him, so he died. The woman on the true crime show pleaded with the judge to show mercy on her behalf, but he turned her down.

In late 2017, self-styled language sleuths set out to determine the true author of a presidential tweet based solely on its use of “pled” as the past participle of “plead.” Amid speculation that lawyer John Dowd penned the tweet under Donald Trump’s name, one observer stirred up a hornet’s nest by asking, “We’re supposed to believe John Dowd wrote pled instead of pleaded?” The implication: Surely, no lawyer would use the obviously incorrect “pled,” right? I understand why people have strong opinions on language. I might have a few myself. But I don’t understand how people who are certain one way is right and another is wrong don’t consult a dictionary before they document their unfounded certainty in a public forum. For example, the person who tweeted that “pleaded” is reserved for intimate personal relationships offered no source for the assertion other than his own absolute certainty. I’ve been writing about language since 2002, researching such matters on a regular basis, and never come across this idea, much less a rule to this effect. So which is right: pled or pleaded? Regular readers probably hear this coming: Both forms are correct. The one you choose should depend on whose authority you accept. Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary says the simple past tense and the past participle form are “pleaded or pled,” in that order. That means you can use both. Webster’s New World College Dictionary takes a narrower view: It gives you just one option: pleaded. American Heritage sides with Merriam’s, stating that pleaded and pled are both acceptable. For regular everyday users, dictionaries are the best authorities. And because some dictionaries allow either “pled” or “pleaded,” you can consider that a green light to use whichever you prefer. But more specialized language authorities aren’t as flexible.

If you’re a tin-eared writer who believes there’s no right or wrong other than what you yourself think, you might analogize plead to read and use plead as a past-tense form . Your choice. But first consider two points. First, in their magisterial Federal Practice and Procedure, the incomparable Charles Alan Wright and Arthur Miller give well-pleaded complaint as the only possibility (see § 3566). Second, in Garner’s Modern American Usage, I quote eight usage authorities insisting that pleaded is the preferable past-tense form — the other forms being inferior (see 3d ed. 2009 at 633-34). If you need still more evidence, see Garner’s Dictionary of Legal Usage (3d ed. 2011 at 682). And if the evidence cited there doesn’t convince you, then you may be a mumpsimus.

The concept of God and morality coinciding is a difficult process to grasp because there is no tangible proof of the existence of God. Although there are aspects of each position that I agree with, I support the theist position in regards to evolution and how the world came to be. Christopher Bennett, when speaking on behalf of the theists, made the claim that “we need to explain the very existence of the universe through there being a perfectly free and powerful being” (Bennett 116). Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution explains how organisms evolved from natural selection and the survival of the fittest. Darwin never mentioned God in his theory nor did he explain why the process of evolution originally occurred. To understand the world in which we live in, we need to “point to a Being powerful enough to start the process of the universe’s development off” (Bennett 116). Science dates back to the big bang, but what happened before it? Bennett implies that there must be a figure behind the world’s creation. Darwin’s theory is scientifically proven as true. Just because his theory is true, does not mean the existence of God is false. Author Stefan Lovgren argues that evolution and religion can coexist. He argues that evolution could be God’s tool in the creation of humans. Lovgren states, “it would be perfectly logical to think that a divine being used evolution as a method to create the world” (Lovgren). In other words, it makes sense that God would use evolution as a method because the ones that are most adapted to the environment survive. Evolution could be used to explain present life, but God could be the ultimate creator who used evolution as a tool (Snellenberger). If we are all God’s children, wouldn’t God want us all to be well adapted so we can survive and prosper? Bennett also discusses the fact that God is the Designer. He states, “where there is a design, there must be a designer” (Bennett 115).

Author Clare Raynard Magoon, Jr. debunks that notion by releasing his new book, “Creation and the Big Bang: How God Created Matter from Nothing,” a perfect blend of a scientific take on the Big Bang theory and a creationist point of view. In the book, Magoon demonstrates through his research and through Scripture (especially Genesis 1:1) that God himself created the heavens and the earth and that this falls perfectly in line with the Big Bang theory and is the only explanation for how we got the universe from nothing. “Creation and the Big Bang” also looks at new scientific discoveries and studies of the founding scientists who studied our origins, clearly demonstrating how the science giants (Bacon, Newton, Planck, Einstein etc) were all believers and sought after a creator behind the mystery of the cosmos. “I’ve always been interested in science and theology and have always felt called to present my point of view and experiences to others,” Magoon said. “I want to reach out to friends, family and strangers who are looking for deeper explanations then those commonly presented by teachers and religious leaders.” An Amazon reviewer praises “Creation and the Big Bang”: “This book successfully tied the Big Bang and Creation together, showing the harmony between the Biblical account of creation and the scientific account. Many new scientific terms were taught in layman's terms, simplifying a complex process. Believing and defending creation is now an easy task.” Readers will be very intrigued in the central messaging to find out how Magoon synthesizes the widely believed Big Bang theory along with the scripture that proves God created the world. “Creation and the Big Bang: How God Created Matter from Nothing” By Clare Raynard Magoon,", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d4", "source_url": "https://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/god-science-co-exist.htm", "snippet": "Can God and science co-exist? | HowStuffWorks God and science was quickly rejected by both atheists and religious adherents. The zoologist and atheist thinker Richard Dawkins called NOMA \"an empty idea\" and pointed that there are a number of areas where science and God compete for an individual's faith [source: Dawkins]. The debate over evolutionary theory is just one such flashpoint. A 2009 study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology suggests that humans can't reconcile two explanations as wildly different as creationism and evolution for their existence. The study found that, when exposed to descriptions of evolutionary theory that make clear that it's supported by science, participants were more susceptible to subliminal messages in support of the theory in a separate test later on. Conversely, those who had read that the theory \"raised more questions than it answered\" were less susceptible [source: Lloyd]. This study doesn't quite prove that science and religion are irreconcilable, though it adds to a body of work on the conflict thesis, a mid-19th century concept that holds that religion and science can't be reconciled. Yet, several humans who subscribe to both faith in God and science show that the two can co-exist. Francis Collins, the founder of the Human Genome Project and a practicing Christian, is an excellent example. At a Pew Research forum, Collins pointed out several pieces of evidence of God's existence. He singled out concepts like the \"unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics,\" an observation by physicist Eugene Wigner that math's most amazing quality is that it works so simply and elegantly [source: Pew Research]. Collins subscribes to the traditional tenets of evolutionary theory, beginning with the Big Bang, but has reconciled it with a belief in God. He believes that God created the Big Bang with the intent to create. Collins isn't alone; a poll taken in 1996 found that 40 percent of scientists say they believe in God [source: Bloom]. That was about the same percentage of Americans who said they believe in the theory of evolution in a 2009 Gallup poll. Twenty-five percent of Americans responded that they don't believe in evolution [source: Newport].", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d5", "source_url": "http://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/life/2015/03/01/intelligent-design-evolution-can-share-classroom/24240423/", "snippet": "Intelligent design, evolution can share a classroom Intelligent design, evolution can share a classroom Clayton Fiscus, a new Republican member of the Montana House of Representatives, claimed that there doesn't have to be one. He has put forth a bill that would force public schools to teach intelligent design, or the belief that a supreme being created the universe, along with the traditional evolutionary theory. No one was present at the conception of the universe, no matter what kind of birth it was. Therefore, we cannot discredit any theories about the beginning of the universe. As a Christian, it is very important to me to be able to learn about how the Bible fits in with scientific theory. I was fortunate enough to attend Foothills, a school that taught me more about this and encouraged me to carry out my own research. Through this endeavor, I was able to discover that one doesn't have to leave science in the dust to be a believer. In fact, when you examine Genesis and compare it to some of the scientific theories in place, especially the Big Bang Theory, it fits very well. The Bible says that God created the world from nothing, and the Big Bang theory says that all matter was created from a single point. However, the Big Bang theory has some gaps. There is no explanation for where the matter that condensed into a single point came from initially, and the gravity involved defies the laws of physics. The idea of an intelligent God who created our universe fills in these gaps very well. That's only one example, but intelligent design does mesh very well with science in general, even non-Christian intelligent design. All religions claim that a supreme being created the earth, and teaching intelligent design would encompass all of these beliefs. While some may argue that Sunday school is the appropriate place to learn about intelligent design and creationism, they're not taking into account the people who either do not have access to or don't feel as if they can attend Sunday school.
