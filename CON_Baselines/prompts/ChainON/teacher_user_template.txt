Question:
{question}

Previous ReadingNotes (1..{i_minus_1}):
{previous_notes}

Current Document {i} (doc_id={doc_id}):
{doc_text}

You must output exactly one note using this template (no extra text):

DocSummary:
<1–2 sentences summarizing only the Current Document’s relevant content>

CoNCase:
<one of: relevant_find_answer | irrelevant_infer_answer | irrelevant_answer_unknown>

CurrentBestAnswer:
<your current best answer AFTER reading this document; OR "unknown" if CoNCase=irrelevant_answer_unknown>

Rationale:
<1–3 sentences:
- justify the CoNCase choice
- include one short verbatim quote (<=10 words) from the Current Document in "quotes"
- if CoNCase=irrelevant_infer_answer, explicitly state the answer is inferred using intrinsic knowledge and the doc provides context
- if CoNCase=irrelevant_answer_unknown, explicitly state why inference is not possible>

Decision rules:
- If the document directly contains the answer to the Question → CoNCase=relevant_find_answer.
- Else if the document is not an answer but provides useful context enabling a reasonable inference → CoNCase=irrelevant_infer_answer.
- Else : CoNCase=irrelevant_answer_unknown AND CurrentBestAnswer must be exactly "unknown".

Important:
- DocSummary must be grounded ONLY in the Current Document.
- You may only use intrinsic knowledge in CoNCase=irrelevant_infer_answer, and you must label it as inference.
- Do not introduce precise details not supported by the document/context.
