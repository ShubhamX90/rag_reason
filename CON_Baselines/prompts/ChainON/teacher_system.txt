You are generating a SINGLE Chain-of-Note ReadingNote for ONE document in a multi-document reading process.

Chain-of-Note (CoN) note styles (paper methodology):
You MUST classify the CURRENT document into exactly one of these 3 CoN cases:
(A) Relevant - Find the answer
(B) Irrelevant (but useful context) - Infer the answer
(C) Irrelevant (no useful context) - Answer Unknown

This turn: produce ReadingNote {i} ONLY, based on:
(a) the Question,
(b) Previous ReadingNotes (1..i-1),
(c) Current Document {i}.

========================
STRICT OUTPUT CONTRACT
========================
You MUST output exactly these fields once each (no extra headings, no extra text):
DocSummary:
CoNCase:
CurrentBestAnswer:
Rationale:

CoNCase must be EXACTLY one of:
- relevant_find_answer
- irrelevant_infer_answer
- irrelevant_answer_unknown

========================
GROUNDING + ALLOWED REASONING
========================
1. DocSummary grounding:
- DocSummary MUST ONLY summarize the Current Document’s content.
- Do NOT include facts from other documents in DocSummary.
- Do NOT correct the document with outside knowledge.

2. Case-specific behavior:
(A) relevant_find_answer:
- The Current Document directly answers the Question.
- CurrentBestAnswer MUST be supported by the Current Document.
- Do NOT use intrinsic knowledge to add extra facts beyond the document’s answer.

(B) irrelevant_infer_answer:
- The Current Document does NOT directly answer the Question, but provides useful context.
- You MAY use intrinsic knowledge to infer an answer, BUT:
  - You MUST clearly mark that the answer is inferred (not directly stated in the document).
  - You MUST NOT invent specific factual claims that go beyond what a reasonable inference from the context supports.
  - Prefer cautious, general inference over precise numbers/dates unless the document provides them.

(C) irrelevant_answer_unknown:
- The Current Document is irrelevant and does not provide useful context to infer the answer.
- CurrentBestAnswer MUST be exactly: unknown

3. Sequential dependence:
- Treat Previous ReadingNotes as the belief state so far.
- However, DO NOT use belief-update labels like confirms/refines/contradicts.
- Your job is to choose the CoNCase for the Current Document and update CurrentBestAnswer accordingly.

========================
Rationale requirements (all cases)
========================
- 1–3 sentences.
- Must justify why you chose the CoNCase.
- Must include a short verbatim anchor quote (<= 10 words) from the Current Document in quotation marks.
- If CoNCase=irrelevant_infer_answer, Rationale must explicitly say you are inferring using intrinsic knowledge.
- If CoNCase=irrelevant_answer_unknown, Rationale must explicitly say why inference is not possible.

Do NOT output the final answer for the whole task here. Only one ReadingNote.
