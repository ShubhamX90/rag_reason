The document notes there are no verified cases of humans living beyond 122 years, though the oldest living person is 119. It explains cellular biology—cells can divide about 50 times before losing replication ability, leading to aging signs. The study found no participants showed biological resilience to reach 150, but notes this conclusion is limited by current medical standards.\n\nCoNCase:\nrelevant_find_answer\n\nCurrentBestAnswer:\nHumans could theoretically live up to 150 years according to research, but no verified cases exist of anyone living beyond 122 years, and current participants showed no biological resilience to reach 150.\n\nRationale:\nThe document directly addresses the question by stating researchers concluded the \"absolute limit\" is \"between 100 and 150\" years. However, it also notes \"not a single participant showed the biological resiliency to live to 150,\" indicating current humans cannot yet reach this theoretical maximum.\n\n---\n\nReadingNote 2 (DocID: d2):\nDocSummary:\nDr. Thomas Perls of Boston Medical Center studies \"super-agers\" (people 110+), of which there are currently 150 known individuals worldwide—extremely rare at one in 5 million. The document notes Jeanne Calment holds the record at 122 years (died 1997). Perls indicates that reaching extreme old age requires unique genetics beyond average healthy lifestyle choices, though good habits (no smoking, exercise, vegetarian diet) can extend life expectancy to 86–89 years.\n\nCoNCase:\nrelevant_find_answer\n\nCurrentBestAnswer:\nHumans cannot currently live beyond 122 years (the verified record), and reaching 110+ requires exceptional genetics; most humans cannot reach 150 even with optimal lifestyle choices.\n\nRationale:\nThe document directly states \"the odds of breaking Calment's record are small\" and that super-agers require \"a unique set of genes.\" The quote \"one in 5 million people lives to be 110 or older\" demonstrates extreme rarity, suggesting 150 is not achievable for current humans.\n\n---\n\nReadingNote 3 (DocID: d3):\nDocSummary:\nGERO.AI researchers analyzed 70,000 people up to age 85 and claim humans can live up to 150 years, with the lifespan limit between 100–150 years. However, none of the analyzed participants showed resilience to reach 150. The document mentions David Sinclair's research on reversing tissue aging in the retina and discusses entrepreneur Dave Asprey's investments in anti-aging technologies (stem cells, cryotherapy). Asprey predicts people under 40 today could live past 100 with future anti-aging treatments.\n\nCoNCase:\nrelevant_find_answer\n\nCurrentBestAnswer:\nResearch suggests humans could theoretically live to 150 years, but current participants show no biological resilience to achieve this; future medical advances might make it possible.\n\nRationale:\nThe document states \"researchers at GERO.AI claim that a human being can live for up to 150 years\" but also notes \"none of the aforementioned participants showed the resiliency to reach the 150-year mark,\" indicating current humans cannot yet achieve this theoretical limit.\n\n---\n\nReadingNote 4 (DocID: d4):\nDocSummary:\nA University of Georgia study analyzing mortality rates across 19 countries over three centuries concludes humans are \"not even close\" to reaching maximum lifespan potential and could reach 150 years. The document notes average life expectancy has risen from 20–40 years historically to around 80 today due to improved nutrition, sanitation, and medicine. Using Bayesian theory, researchers found \"mortality limits have only been postponed\" and longevity records may increase significantly in coming decades. Another study suggests life expectancy could almost double, going beyond 150.\n\nCoNCase:\nrelevant_find_answer\n\nCurrentBestAnswer:\nAccording to recent research, humans are \"not even close\" to reaching maximum lifespan and could potentially reach 150 years or beyond as medical advances continue.\n\nRationale:\nThe document directly states humans are \"not yet approaching\" the maximum limit and that \"longevity records may therefore increase significantly.\" It supports the possibility of reaching 150 years with future improvements, though it does not claim humans currently can achieve this.\n\n---\n\nReadingNote 5 (DocID: d5):\nDocSummary:\nA Nature Communications study by Gero (Singapore-based biotech) and Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center analyzed DNA and medical data from hundreds of thousands of UK and US volunteers. They developed an AI app to estimate biological aging and maximum lifespan. The study identified two key parameters: biological age (linked to stress, lifestyle, disease) and resilience (how quickly the body recovers). The team concluded the longest humans are likely to live is 150 years, almost double the current UK average of 81 years.\n\nCoNCase:\nrelevant_find_answer\n\nCurrentBestAnswer:\nScientific research concludes the maximum human lifespan is likely 150 years, determined by biological age and resilience factors; this is almost double current average lifespans.\n\nRationale:\nThe document directly states \"the longest any human is likely to ever live is 150 years\" based on analysis of biological aging parameters. This provides a clear upper bound for human longevity based on current biological understanding.\n\n---\n\nReadingNote 6 (DocID: d6):\nDocSummary:\nA study led by Vijg examined longevity data from France, Japan, UK, and US (countries with most supercentenarians). The research found maximum age rose from ~110 in the 1970s to 115 by early 1990s, then plateaued after 1995 when Jeanne Calment died at 122. The odds of anyone living past 125 in any given year are less than 1 in 10,000. Despite medical advances, the oldest people are not living longer. The document suggests a biological \"ceiling\" exists, likely hardwired into our DNA damage accumulation.\n\nCoNCase:\nrelevant_find_answer\n\nCurrentBestAnswer:\nEvidence shows a plateau in maximum human lifespan at around 115 years since the 1990s, with odds of exceeding 125 being less than 1 in 10,000; a biological ceiling likely prevents reaching 150.\n\nRationale:\nThe document states \"our maximum age rose from around 110 to 115—and then stopped after 1995\" and calculates odds of living past 125 as \"less than 1 in 10,000,\" suggesting a hard biological limit well below 150 years.\n\n---\n\nReadingNote 7 (DocID: d7):\nDocSummary:\nGero research examines physiological resilience—the body's ability to bounce back from stress. An 80-year-old requires three times longer to recover than a 40-year-old. The study analyzed health data from US, UK, and Russia using blood cell counts and step counts from wearables. Researchers concluded human body resilience completely declines at some age between 120 and 150. The document notes the body loses all ability to recover from stressors before age 150, aligning with similar studies suggesting maximum possible age around 138 years.\n\nCoNCase:\nrelevant_find_answer\n\nCurrentBestAnswer:\nResearch indicates human physiological resilience—the ability to recover from stress—completely declines between ages 120 and 150, setting a biological limit on lifespan.\n\nRationale:\nThe document states \"human body resilience is completely gone at some age between 120 and 150,\" directly addressing the upper bound of human longevity. This provides a mechanism (loss of resilience) explaining why 150 represents a maximum.\n\n---\n\nReadingNote 8 (DocID: d8):\nDocSummary:\nA Nature Communications study by Gero (Singapore biotech) and Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center examined large groups in US, UK, and Russia. The research identified \"physiological resilience\"—the ability to bounce back from setbacks—as the main factor limiting lifespan. The study concludes humans are limited to 120–150 years maximum. Researchers analyzed blood cell counts and step counts across age groups (early adulthood 16–35, middle age 35–65, older age 65+) as hallmarks of aging.\n\nCoNCase:\nrelevant_find_answer\n\nCurrentBestAnswer:\nScientific research identifies physiological resilience (ability to recover from stress) as the limiting factor, concluding humans can live at most 120–150 years.\n\nRationale:\nThe document directly states the study found \"a ceiling on how long you can extend your life\" and that \"physiological resilience\" limits lives to \"120 to 150 years at the most.\"\n\n---\n\nReadingNote 9 (DocID: d9):\nDocSummary:\nThe document distinguishes between lifespan (maximum years an individual can live) and life expectancy (average age). It notes Jeanne Calment's record of 122 years and 5 months as the longest recorded lifespan. The document explains that life expectancy has increased due to reduced infant mortality and improved healthcare, but notes humans have lived into their 70s and 80s since ancient times. It provides historical context that some individuals reached 100 in the first century.\n\nCoNCase:\nrelevant_find_answer\n\nCurrentBestAnswer:\nThe verified maximum human lifespan record is 122 years and 5 months (Jeanne Calment); no humans have exceeded this, and reaching 150 remains unverified.\n\nRationale:\nThe document states \"The longest recorded lifespan was Jeanne Calment who lived for 122 years and 5 months,\" establishing the current verified maximum. It does not support the possibility of reaching 150 years based on actual human achievement.\n\n---\n\nReadingNote 10 (DocID: d10):\nDocSummary:\nThe document discusses anti-aging research and the possibility of humans living to 200 years or beyond. It notes Jeanne Calment lived to 122 (died 1997) and mentions debate about whether humans can naturally live much beyond that age. Dr. Andrew Steele, a computational biologist, states there is \"no biological reason humans can't reach the age of 200\" and believes breakthrough drugs removing \"zombie cells\" could be available in 10 years. The document suggests someone reading it could reach 150 with future anti-aging drugs.\n\nCoNCase:\nirrelevant_infer_answer\n\nCurrentBestAnswer:\nSome scientists believe future anti-aging drugs could enable humans to reach 150 years or beyond, though this remains speculative and unproven.\n\nRationale:\nThe document presents speculative future possibilities rather than current biological evidence. Dr. Steele's claim that \"someone reading this could make it to 150 with the help of the drugs\" is aspirational rather than grounded in current human achievement. I am inferring using intrinsic knowledge that such claims remain theoretical.\n\n---\n\nRelevanceDiscussion:\nDocuments d1, d3, d5, d7, and d8 directly address the question by presenting research concluding humans could theoretically live up to 150 years based on biological analysis. Documents d2, d4, and d6 provide relevant context: d2 discusses current limits and genetic requirements, d4 suggests humans haven't reached maximum potential, and d6 presents evidence of a plateau around 115 years. Document d9 establishes the verified record of 122 years. Document d10 discusses speculative future possibilities. Overall, the documents show a consensus that 150 years represents a theoretical biological upper limit, but no humans have achieved this, and evidence suggests a plateau exists around 115 years.\n\nFinalAnswer:\nResearch suggests humans could theoretically live up to 150 years based on biological analysis of physiological resilience and aging mechanisms.[d1][d5][d7][d8] However, no verified cases of humans living beyond 122 years exist, and evidence indicates a plateau in maximum lifespan around 115 years since the 1990s.[d2][d6][d9] While some scientists believe future medical advances might enable reaching 150 years, current humans cannot achieve this theoretical maximum.[d4][d10]"}

Earlier, around 1000 A.D., Ethiopians made a wine-like drink from coffee berries, and before that, East African tribes consumed coffee as a paste mixed with animal fat.\n\nRationale:\nThe document explicitly states \"it was there, during the 11th century that coffee was first developed into a hot drink\" on the Arabian Peninsula. This provides a clear timeline for when coffee became a hot beverage, distinguishing it from earlier consumption methods.\n\nReadingNote 3 (DocID: d3):\nDocSummary:\nThis document presents the legend of Kaldi the goat herder in the 9th century on the Ethiopian plateau and describes how the abbot of a monastery created a drink from the cherries.

It notes that by the 16th century, coffee was known in Persia, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey. It states that \"The world's first coffee house opened in Constantinople in 1475,\" where people drank coffee as part of daily routine and at social gatherings.\n\nCoNCase:\nrelevant_find_answer\n\nCurrentBestAnswer:\nCoffee originated in Ethiopia and was exported to Yemen in the 15th century, where it began to be grown and consumed as a beverage. The world's first coffee house opened in Constantinople in 1475, indicating coffee was being drunk as a beverage by the 15th century.\n\nRationale:\nThe document states \"it's thought that coffee originated in Ethiopia\" and \"made its way north across the red sea into Yemen in the 15th Century.

Documents d1, d3, d5, and d7 provide supporting context about coffee's origins and early consumption in Yemen and Ethiopia. Documents d4, d9, and d10 are less directly relevant, focusing on coffee's spread to Europe and America rather than its initial development as a beverage.\n\nFinalAnswer:\nCoffee was first developed into a hot drink during the 11th century on the Arabian Peninsula.[d2] However, as a drink more broadly, coffee probably dates from the 15th century when it was being cultivated and consumed in Yemen.[d6] The 13th century marked an important development when people began heating or roasting the beans, which was \"the first step in making coffee as we know it today.\"[d8]"}

Yoga also cultivates breath awareness, prevents muscle degeneration, and provides physical benefits like improved flexibility, balance, and coordination.\n\nCoNCase:\nrelevant_find_answer\n\nCurrentBestAnswer:\nYoga cannot increase actual skeletal height, but it can make you appear taller by improving posture and reducing spinal compression through muscular strength development.\n\nRationale:\nThe document directly states \"Doing yoga won't increase your skeletal height\" but clarifies that \"you may appear and feel taller after you elongate your spine and improve your posture.\" This provides a clear distinction between actual height increase and appearance.\n\n---\n\nReadingNote 2 (DocID: d2):\nDocSummary:\nThis document claims that yoga can help increase height even after puberty through specific asanas. It attributes this to yoga's ability to activate growth hormones naturally in both adults and children. The document lists specific poses like Tadasana and Vrikshasana, claiming they can help gain \"an extra inch or even a few centimeters.\"\n\nCoNCase:\nrelevant_find_answer\n\nCurrentBestAnswer:\nAccording to this source, yoga can help increase height after puberty by activating growth hormones through specific asanas, potentially gaining extra inches or centimeters.\n\nRationale:\nThe document states \"yoga can help get those few inches because yoga poses help stretch your body and back\" and claims \"The practice of yoga is known to increase your growth hormone.\" However, this contradicts the medical consensus in d1, suggesting this source may be making unsupported claims.\n\n---\n\nReadingNote 3 (DocID: d3):\nDocSummary:\nThis document explains that yoga can \"kind of\" increase height indirectly by improving posture and helping you stand taller, but emphasizes that the primary benefits are psychological—boosting self-confidence and overall body awareness. It recommends yoga poses that focus on stretching and lengthening the spine, shoulders, and lower back, particularly Yin yoga.\n\nCoNCase:\nrelevant_find_answer\n\nCurrentBestAnswer:\nYoga can potentially make you stand and appear taller by straightening the spine, but its most important benefits are improving well-being, self-esteem, and confidence rather than actual height increase.\n\nRationale:\nThe document states \"Yoga has the indirect potential to make you stand and appear taller by straightening your spine. But most importantly, it can improve well being, self-esteem and boost confidence.\" This clarifies the distinction between appearance and actual height.\n\n---\n\nReadingNote 4 (DocID: d4):\nDocSummary:\nThis document discusses height increase methods for adults, noting that exercising (including yoga) can help maintain overall health and reduce osteoporosis risk. It emphasizes that good posture is crucial, as poor posture can make you look shorter and affect actual height over time. The document recommends yoga as a whole-body practice that can strengthen muscles, align the body, and improve posture to help you stand taller.\n\nCoNCase:\nrelevant_find_answer\n\nCurrentBestAnswer:\nYoga can help you stand taller by strengthening muscles and improving posture, and it may help prevent height loss in adulthood by reducing osteoporosis risk, though actual height increase after puberty is limited.\n\nRationale:\nThe document states \"give yoga a try.

This will help you stand taller.\" It also notes \"In most cases, you reach your peak height by the time you're done with puberty.\"\n\n---\n\nReadingNote 5 (DocID: d5):\nDocSummary:\nThis document claims that yoga is an ancient technique that can help increase height by producing growth hormones when the mind is relaxed and stress-free. It suggests that yoga improves posture, enhances blood circulation, and aids organ health. The document lists specific yoga postures claimed to increase height, including Tadasana.\n\nCoNCase:\nrelevant_find_answer\n\nCurrentBestAnswer:\nAccording to this source, yoga can increase height by stimulating growth hormone production through relaxation and stress reduction, combined with improved posture from practicing specific asanas.\n\nRationale:\nThe document claims \"With the mind relaxed and stress free, the body can easily produces the Growth Hormone, which is responsible for the increase in height.\" However, this claim about growth hormone activation lacks scientific support compared to d1's evidence-based approach.\n\n---\n\nReadingNote 6 (DocID: d6):\nDocSummary:\nThis document explains that yoga may help loosen muscles, increase flexibility, and improve posture, providing the appearance of more height. It cites a 2016 study showing yoga increased bone density in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, suggesting yoga may help prevent age-related height loss. The document notes that after age 30, people may lose up to half an inch per decade due to osteoporosis and spinal compression.\n\nCoNCase:\nrelevant_find_answer\n\nCurrentBestAnswer:\nYoga can help you appear taller by improving posture and flexibility, and it may prevent height loss in adulthood by increasing bone density and preventing osteoporosis-related compression.\n\nRationale:\nThe document states \"Doing yoga may help loosen the muscles and lead to increased body flexibility and better posture, providing the appearance of more height\" and notes that \"yoga may prevent the loss of height in adulthood\" through bone density improvements.\n\n---\n\nReadingNote 7 (DocID: d7):\nDocSummary:\nThis document clarifies that while there are no particular yoga poses for height increase after age 18 (since height is primarily genetic), yoga can lengthen and strengthen muscles in the back, neck, and shoulders to improve posture and alignment. It suggests certain poses may stimulate the pituitary gland and promote growth hormone release, though the impact is not fully understood. The document lists ways yoga contributes to a taller appearance.\n\nCoNCase:\nrelevant_find_answer\n\nCurrentBestAnswer:\nYoga cannot increase actual height after 18 due to genetics, but it can make you appear taller by lengthening and strengthening back and shoulder muscles, improving posture and spinal alignment.\n\nRationale:\nThe document explicitly states \"While there are no particular poses of yoga for height increase after 18, since height increase is primarily a function of genetics, yoga poses can help lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the back, neck, and shoulders, which can improve posture and alignment.\"\n\n---\n\nReadingNote 8 (DocID: d8):\nDocSummary:\nThis document claims that yoga can be used to increase height and cites a trainer suggesting height may increase until age 23-24 when growth hormone secretion stops. It describes specific poses like Tadasana and Vrikshasana, claiming they stretch body muscles and facilitate growth hormone production through posture pressure and pituitary gland activation.\n\nCoNCase:\nrelevant_find_answer\n\nCurrentBestAnswer:\nAccording to this source, yoga may help increase height until age 23-24 through specific poses that stretch muscles and activate the pituitary gland to produce growth hormones.\n\nRationale:\nThe document quotes a trainer saying \"you may have a chance to increase your height till the age of 23-24 years after which the body stops secreting the growth hormone.\" However, this claim about growth hormone activation through yoga poses lacks scientific validation.\n\n---\n\nReadingNote 9 (DocID: d9):\nDocSummary:\nThis document claims that yoga postures can be helpful in increasing height if followed diligently under expert supervision. It asserts that regular yoga training can tone back muscles and spine, improve blood circulation, and increase energy. The document lists specific poses like Vriksasana and Cat Pose, claiming they stretch muscles and increase height.\n\nCoNCase:\nrelevant_find_answer\n\nCurrentBestAnswer:\nThis source claims yoga can increase height through muscle stretching and spinal extension, with the author asserting from personal experience that \"yoga increases height\" and that height gain is possible even after age 21.\n\nRationale:\nThe document states \"From my personal experience that I have noticed in myself and in many of my known people I can strongly say that yoga increases height.\" However, this is anecdotal evidence without scientific support, contrasting with evidence-based sources.\n\n---\n\nReadingNote 10 (DocID: d10):\nDocSummary:\nThis document suggests yoga may help increase height by improving posture, flexibility, and strength. It claims that when joints and muscles lengthen through flexibility, this can add inches to height. The document recommends practicing yoga regularly and consulting a yoga instructor, noting there are no guarantees but yoga is \"safe, effective, and definitely worth a try.\"\n\nCoNCase:\nrelevant_find_answer\n\nCurrentBestAnswer:\nYoga may help increase height by improving posture, flexibility, and strength, allowing joints and muscles to lengthen, though there are no guarantees of actual height increase.\n\nRationale:\nThe document states \"yoga can help to increase your flexibility. When you are flexible, your joints and muscles are able to lengthen, which can also help to add a few inches to your height.\" This conflates muscle flexibility with actual skeletal height increase.\n\n---\n\nReadingNote 11 (DocID: d11):\nDocSummary:\nThis document claims yoga can help achieve a taller frame by practicing specific asanas that stretch the body and increase flexibility. It states that yoga helps straighten and realign the spinal cord, resulting in taller posture. The document lists poses like Tadasana and Bhujangasana, claiming they facilitate growth hormone formation and increase height.\n\nCoNCase:\nrelevant_find_answer\n\nCurrentBestAnswer:\nAccording to this source, yoga can help achieve a taller frame by stretching the body, increasing flexibility, and straightening the spinal cord, which facilitates growth hormone formation.\n\nRationale:\nThe document states \"Your body feels the elongation of the pose, which also facilitates the formation of growth hormones by the body\" and claims yoga \"may result in taller posture.\" However, the mechanism of growth hormone stimulation through yoga poses is not scientifically established.\n\n---\n\nReadingNote 12 (DocID: d12):\nDocSummary:\nThis document clarifies that the popular myth that yoga makes you taller is not true. It explains that yoga helps build muscular strength supporting better posture and teaches breathing focus, which aids posture—making you appear taller but not actually growing. The document emphasizes that no exercises make you grow once you've reached maximum height, though muscle building can support posture and confidence.\n\nCoNCase:\nrelevant_find_answer\n\nCurrentBestAnswer:\nYoga does not actually make you grow taller; it is a myth. Yoga builds muscular strength and improves posture, which may make you appear taller, but it does not increase actual height.\n\nRationale:\nThe document directly states \"In reality, a regular yoga practice helps build muscular strength, which can support better posture\" and clarifies \"yoga may make you appear taller, but it's not actually making you grow.\" This provides a clear debunking of the height-increase myth.\n\n---\n\nRelevanceDiscussion:\nAll twelve documents are relevant to the question about whether yoga helps increase height. Documents d1, d3, d4, d6, d7, and d12 provide evidence-based information distinguishing between actual height increase (which does not occur) and appearance of height (which improves through posture). Documents d2, d5, d8, d9, d10, and d11 make claims about yoga increasing actual height through growth hormone stimulation, though these claims lack scientific support. The most reliable sources (d1, d7, d12) clearly state that yoga cannot increase skeletal height after growth plates close, but can improve posture and appearance.\n\nFinalAnswer:\nYoga cannot increase actual skeletal height, particularly after age 20 when growth plates close, as height is primarily determined by genetics.[d1][d7][d12] However, yoga can make you appear taller by improving posture, strengthening muscles in the back and shoulders, and reducing spinal compression, potentially adding several inches to your apparent height.[d1][d3][d4][d6] Additionally, yoga may help prevent age-related height loss in adults by improving bone density and reducing osteoporosis-related spinal compression.[d6] While some sources claim yoga stimulates growth hormones, the most evidence-based sources clarify that yoga improves appearance and posture rather than actual height growth.[d12]"}
