In this module, you can explore some of the conflicts that arose during President Clinton’s administration and the ways in which the President used military force to ensure the safety of the United States and its allies. Ethnic Cleansing in Bosnia In February 1992, the largely Muslim nation of Bosnia declared its independence from the ailing remnants of Yugoslavia. Two months later, Serbia, the most powerful of the former Yugoslav Republics, invaded Bosnia with the goal of annexing large swathes of the country for the creation of a “greater Serbia.” After making substantial gains, the Serbian Army settled into a system of ethnic cleansing, seeking to purge their occupied lands of all Bosnian Muslims. Click on the memo above to read an intelligence report detailing Serbia's war aims in Bosnia. Early on in the conflict, President Clinton followed the events while supporting peace talks spearheaded by the United Nations and European Commission. However, as the above intelligence report on Serbian War aims shows, Serbia was not likely to abide by the terms and had continued its campaign of ethnic cleansing while talks were held. For President Clinton, it was clear that the security of the Bosnian people, and perhaps the greater stability of the Balkans, hung in the balance.

Some scholars believe the Commander in Chief Clause confers expansive powers on the President, but others argue that even if that is the case, the Constitution does not define precisely the extent of those powers. These scholars tend to construe the Clause narrowly, asserting that the Founders gave the President the title to preserve civilian supremacy over the military, not to provide additional powers outside of a Congressional authorization or declaration of war. After the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon Administrations spent nearly a decade committing U.S. troops to Southeast Asia without Congressional approval, in 1973 Congress responded by passing the War Powers Resolution . The Resolution sought to halt the erosion of Congress's ability to participate in war-making decisions, an aim furthered by the Resolution's requirement that the President communicate to Congress the commitment of troops within 48 hours. Further, the statute requires the President to remove all troops after 60 days if Congress has not granted an extension. Presidents have typically considered the War Powers Resolution to be unconstitutional, and so they have tended not to follow it. This unwillingness has never been challenged by another actor (congress, civilians, etc), so the Supreme Court has never decided on the issue. (This is because the legislative branch is reactionary, meaning the Supreme Court could not get involved unless a suit is brought and makes its way up to the court).

Humans 'not even close' to reaching the maximum ... Living to 150? Humans ‘not even close’ to reaching the maximum lifespan ATHENS, Ga. — Human lifespans are capable of soaring past the current record of 122 years, with people possibly reaching the age of 150, a new study explains. According to a researcher at the University of Georgia, we are “not even close” to reaching the maximum potential lifespan. The findings are based on an analysis of mortality rates going back more than three centuries across 19 countries. Lead author Dr. David McCarthy describes the implications as “profound.” For most of recorded human history, the average life expectancy has been between 20 and 40 years. Today, humans live to be around 80 years-old. Improved nutrition, clean water, better sanitation, and the application of medical science have been key to prolonging life. Experts suspect genetic manipulation, calorie restriction, and new medicines may extend life even further. The team in the study combined reasoning and probability – known as Bayesian theory – to work out potential maximum longevity. Results showed mortality limits have only been postponed in recent years due to records being slow to increase. “As these cohorts attain advanced ages in coming decades, longevity records may therefore increase significantly. Our results confirm prior work suggesting that if there is a maximum limit to the human lifespan, we are not yet approaching it.” (Credit: Anna Shvets from Pexels) So, how long can people really live? Two years ago, another study found life expectancy has the capacity to almost double, going beyond 150. Those findings were based on blood samples from thousands of British and American participants. “Whether or not there is a limit to the human lifespan has been a subject of debate for millennia,” Dr. McCarthy continues. “Historical estimates of the maximum possible lifespan strongly suggest it has increased substantially over recorded history.” The Bible famously records the Hebrews as regarding 80 years as the maximum length of a human life. Around 1,000 years later, the ancient Romans set their official estimate at 100 or 110.", "timestamp": ""}, {"doc_id": "d5", "source_url": "https://guardian.ng/features/why-humans-cannot-live-beyond-150-years-by-study/", "snippet": "Why humans cannot live beyond 150 years, by study | The Guardian ...

They developed an app to predict the maximum lifespan. The study was published in the journal Nature Communications. Experts in biology and biophysics fed an artificial intelligence system vast amounts of Deoxy ribonucleic Acid (DNA)/genetic material and medical data, on hundreds of thousands of volunteers in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US). This allowed them to develop an AI-driven iPhone app that, with simple input from a user, can accurately estimate the rate of biological ageing and maximum lifespan. As part of the big data study, they found there were two key parameters responsible for human lifespan, both covering lifestyle factors and how the body responds. The first factor is biological age, linked to stress, lifestyle and disease, and the second is resilience, reflecting how quickly the first factor returns to normal. This allowed the team to determine that the longest any human is likely to ever live is 150 years; almost double the current UK average lifespan of 81 years.

But after Calment, there was no one else. It was 115 … 115 … 115.” To see if that perceived plateau was real, Dong, Milholland, and Vijg turned to two international databaseson longevity and worked out the oldest individuals who died in any given year. They specifically looked at France, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the U.S.—the four countries with the most supercentenarians, people who live to 110 years or more. The data were clear. Between the 1970s and early 1990s, our maximum age rose from around 110 to 115—and then stopped after 1995, shortly before Jeanne Calment died. In fact, Vijg’s team calculated that in any given year, the odds that at least one person in the world will live past their 125th birthday are less than 1 in 10,000. Despite sanitation, antibiotics, vaccines, and other medical advances, the oldest living people simply aren’t dying any later. They’re unlikely to either, regardless of calorie restriction, drugs like rapamycin, and all of our other efforts to slow the flow of sand through the hourglass. “In science, you never know,” says Vijg. “But I’ve not seen anything that I think would break through the ceiling.” The ceiling is probably hardwired into our biology.

Science is once again casting doubt on the idea that we could live to be nearly as old as the biblical Methuselah or Mel Brooks' famous 2,000-year-old man. New research from Singapore-base biotech company Gero looks at how well the human body bounces back from disease, accidents or just about anything else that puts stress on its systems. This basic resilience declines as people age, with an 80-year-old requiring three times as long to recover from stresses as a 40-year-old on average. This should make sense if you've ever known an elderly person who has taken a nasty fall. Recovery from such a spill can be lif- threatening for a particularly frail person, whereas a similar fall might put a person half as old out of commission for just a short time and teenagers might simply dust themselves off and keep going. Extrapolate this decline further, and human body resilience is completely gone at some age between 120 and 150, according to new analysis performed by the researchers. In other words, at some point your body loses all ability to recover from pretty much any potential stressor. The researchers arrived at this conclusion by looking at health data for large groups from the US, the UK and Russia. They looked at blood cell counts as well as step counts recorded by wearables. As people experienced different stressors, fluctuations in blood cell and step counts showed that recovery time grew longer as individuals grew older. The new research contains a certain amount of validation for the idea that humans start dying from the moment we're born, but the process seems to speed up significantly somewhere in the mid-thirties to mid-forties when the body's resilience starts to decline more steeply.

But the thing that's keeping the human body from reaching immortality is surprisingly mundane: over time, your body loses the \"physiological resilience,\" or the ability to bounce back, that you once had in your younger years.

But, the lines are not that clear. Life expectancy and lifespan are two different factors of human well-being that measure longevity. Lifespan refers to the maximum number of years an individual can live, making lifespan unique to everyone. The longest recorded lifespan was Jeanne Calment who lived for 122 years and 5 months, making the maximum possible human lifespan 122 years and 5 months – that is, until someone outlives Calment. Life expectancy, on the other hand, refers to the average age an individual can expect to live at different stages of life. As humans age, physical and cognitive challenges can emerge, making life expectancy a dynamic measurement that changes based on different experiences and lifestyles of an individual. This does not mean that 48 years-old was considered “old” in say, the 1850s. But 48 was the average age that individuals could expect to live to during that time. It turns out that infant mortality rates sharply drive down the average life expectancy in a population (i.e., the number of child deaths in certain regions is so high that there are more childhood deaths than adult deaths, lowering life expectancy for that region). You might think that, since our ability to safely manage childbirth and provide childcare has vastly improved since the 19th century, then children would have a greater chance of surviving into adolescence and even older adulthood. While yes, this is true, and yes, it has certainly contributed to an increase in the human lifespan, humans have been living well into their 70s and 80s since ancient times.

Medical advances in the last century have led to humans in wealthy nations living into their 80s, almost double the average life expectancy at the turn of the 20th century. Improved nutrition, clean water, better sanitation and huge leaps in medicine have been key in prolonging human life. The oldest known person — the Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who sold canvases to Vincent Van Gogh when she was a girl in the late 1800s — lived to the age of 122, dying in 1997. There is some debate about whether humans can naturally live much beyond that age, but it is hoped that science will take human lifespans beyond what is currently thought possible. Dr Andrew Steele, a British computational biologist and author of a new book on longevity, told MailOnline there is no biological reason humans can't reach the age of 200. He believes the big breakthrough will come in the form of drugs that remove 'zombie cells' in the body, which are thought to be one of the main culprits of tissue and organ decay as we age. Pills that flush these cells out of the body are already in human trials in and could be on the market in as little as 10 years, according to Dr Steele, who believes someone reading this could make it to 150 with the help of the drugs. Another field in particular that piques the interest of anti-ageing scientists is the study of DNA of reptiles and other cold-blooded animals. Michigan State University experts have begun studying dozens different types of long-living reptiles and amphibians — including crocodiles, salamanders and turtles that can live as long as 120 years. The team hope they will uncover 'traits' that can also be targeted in humans.", "timestamp": ""}]}

Photograph by Aaron Huey, courtesy of the National Geographic image collection Denali, also called Mount McKinley, is the tallest mountain in North America, located in south-central Alaska. With a peak that reaches 6,190 meters (20,310 feet) above sea level, Denali is the third-highest of the Seven Summits (the tallest peaks on all seven continents). Denali is about 210 kilometers (130 miles) north-northwest of Anchorage. Sixty million years ago, tectonic uplift pushed Earth's crust upward, forming Denali and the other Alaska Range mountains. Denali is the centerpiece of the Denali National Park and Preserve, which spans 2.4 million hectares (6 million acres) of land. “Denali” comes from Koyukon, a traditional Native Alaskan language, and means “the tall one.” This name had been used for many generations and was used by early non-Native researchers and naturalists. But in 1896, William A. Dickey, a prospector, began calling Denali “Mount McKinley,” in honor of William McKinley, a presidential candidate at the time. After McKinley became president and was later assassinated, Congress formally recognized the name in 1917, despite McKinley’s tenuous ties to Alaska (he had never visited). But Native Alaskans, as well as locals of varied backgrounds, continued to call the mountain Denali. In 1975, a movement began to rename the mountain Denali, but it was blocked by politicians in Ohio, McKinley’s home state. Finally, President Barack Obama and Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell took action in 2015 to change the name back to Denali, which is now its official name.", "timestamp": "2023-10-19"}]}

By the year 1763 Venice alone accounted for more than 200 coffee shops,[54] and the health benefits of the miraculous drink were celebrated by many. Some representatives of the Catholic Church opposed coffee at its first introduction in Italy, believing it to be the \"Devil's drink\",[18]: 24? but Pope Clement VIII, after trying the aromatic drink himself, gave it his blessing, thus boosting further its commercial success and diffusion. Upon tasting coffee, Pope Clement VIII declared: \"Why, this Satan's drink is so delicious that it would be a pity to let the infidels have exclusive use of it. \"[55] Clement allegedly blessed the bean because it appeared better for the people than alcoholic beverages.[56] The year often cited is 1600.

History of Coffee History of Coffee Historians are quite certain that coffee beans (actually \"pits\") were first eaten, not drunk, in Ethiopia, East Africa, around 575 A.D. There are several legends on how coffee was actually first discovered. The most popular story takes place in the foothills of Yemen in 850 A.D. It is said that a goat herder named Kaldi discovered that his goats were eating the leaves and berries from an unknown tree with cherry-like fruit. After a full meal the goats became full of pep and energy. Some even say that they were dancing. Kaldi suspected that the intoxication was caused by the berry the goats were eating. He tried the berry himself and found that he too was suddenly energetic. Soon a monk noticed Kaldi's vigor and asked the goatherder what caused it. Kaldi told him about the plant and the monk picked the berries and brought them back to the monastery where the monks used them to stay awake for late night prayer and study. Another story tells of a man condemned by his enemies to wander the desert and eventually die of starvation. In his delirium, the young man heard a voice instructing him to eat the fruit from a nearby coffee tree. Confused, he tried to soften the beans in water, and when this failed, he simply drank the liquid. Interpreting his survival and energy as a sign of God, he returned to his people, spreading the faith and the recipe. While these stories are surely fiction, historians do agree on the following: East African tribes would grind the coffee cherries together, mixing the results into a paste with animal fat. Rolled into little balls, the mixture was said to give warriors much-needed energy for battle. Later, around the year 1000 AD, Ethiopians concocted a type of wine from coffee berries, fermenting the dried beans in water.

We don’t have official documentation to confirm exactly who discovered coffee trees for the first time, or who invented coffee as the beverage we know today. However, we do have colorful legends we can use to piece together a rich tapestry of coffee history—and follow coffee’s journey across the globe. 9th Century: Innovation on the Ethiopian Plateau According to legend, a goat herder named Kaldi was the first person who discovered coffee beans and their benefits. Kaldi noticed that after his goats ate the cherries of a particular tree in the ancient coffee forests of the Ethiopian plateau, they were so full of energy that they didn’t want to sleep at night. Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who struggled to stay awake during the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot made a drink with the cherries and found that it kept him alert. In other words, according to the story, the person who invented coffee did so for the most relatable reason possible. After the abbot shared his discovery with the other monks at the monastery—sharing is caring, after all—knowledge of the energizing berries began to spread, moving east. 15th-16th Centuries: Coffee Culture Develops on the Arabian Peninsula The business edition of coffee history began on the Arabian Peninsula, where people cultivated and traded coffee for the first time. By the 15th century, coffee was being grown in what is now Yemen, and by the 16th century it gained popularity in what we now know as Iran, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey.

The origin of this phrase is in dispute; a common story is that in World War I the US Secretary of the Navy Josephus \"Joe\" Daniels banned alcohol on navy ships which meant that the strongest drink available aboard the ship was black coffee. Sailors began referring to coffee as a \"cup of Joe\" in reference to Daniels. However, this story may be apocryphal since the first written account of it was in 1930, some 15 years later. Another explanation is that a formerly popular nickname for coffee, jamoke, from mocha java, was shortened to Joe. A third origin story is that since coffee is such a commonly consumed beverage, it is the drink of the average Joe.[200][201][202] ^Bonné, Jon (29 October 2003). \"Meet espresso's exacting master\".

The world’s first coffee house opened in 1475 in Constantinople, now known as Istanbul. Visitors engaged in conversation, gossiped and caught up on news while enjoying their favourite coffee. The word quickly spread As it’s thought that coffee originated in Ethiopia, it’s also believed it made its way north across the red sea into Yemen in the 15th Century. It then started to be grown in the Yemeni district of Arabia, and by the 16th century it was known in Persia, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey. It was immensely popular for its qualities to help improve alertness and wakefulness, allowing people to devote more time to spiritual matters and praying. The world’s first coffee house The world’s first coffee house was opened in Constantinople in 1475, now known as Istanbul. Coffee was drunk at home as part of the daily routine, as well as to show hospitality to guests. Outside of the home, people visited coffee houses to not only drink coffee but to engage in conversation, listen to music, watch performers, play chess, gossip and catch up on news. Without the modern technologies we have today, coffee houses quickly became the epicentre for exchanging and gathering information. They were often referred to as “Schools of the Wise”. And with thousands of pilgrims visiting Mecca each year from all over the world, knowledge of this “wine of Araby”, as it quickly became known, began to spread. Over to Europe Then the course of coffee history begins to change. This exotic beverage certainly caused a stir for European travellers who were filled with intrigue and fascination.

What was Coffee Originally Called? The word “coffee” has roots in several languages. As news of the berries traveled through Yemen, it was called qahwah, a romantic term for wine. Through Turkey, it became the Turkish kahveh and then Dutch koffie before settling into the English word, coffee. What Did People Drink Before Coffee? While tea has been around since before our favorite goat herder happened upon the coffee bean tree, there were other drinks that were commonplace for morning consumption even before tea. Wine and beer were seen as breakfast drinks since ancient Greek times. In fact, in the 1800s, the English viewed beer as the only appropriate breakfast drink. Back then, no one was given a hard time for downing a mug of ale before heading off to work because beer for breakfast was commonplace. However, that was because the water could often kill you. And the actual alcohol content of beer was only 0.5 – 2.0%. It was rather weak but did provide the carbs needed to give energy and a full feeling to get people through the day. How was Coffee First Consumed? The coffee bean is found in the cherry-like fruit of a coffee plant. Very early on, the fruit would be mixed with animal fat to create a protein-rich snack bar. Evolving through fermentation processes and other uses, a drink was created by using the whole coffee fruit, including the beans and the hull.

Coffee became especially popular in Turkey, and the spread of the Ottoman Empire brought the beverage to many more places. The drink was introduced into one European country after another throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, likely starting with Venetian merchants. Many accounts are recorded of its prohibition or approval as a religious, political, and medical potion. Its association with Muslims and its novel stimulating effects led some to urge Pope Clement VIII to forbid it in the late 1500s, but the pope famously gave it his blessing after sampling the drink for himself. Coffee spread fairly rapidly throughout Europe, and by the end of the 17th century the drink was flourishing across Britain, the British colonies in America, and nearly all of continental Europe. Until the close of the 17th century the world’s limited supply of coffee was obtained almost entirely from the province of Yemen in southern Arabia. But with the increasing popularity of the beverage, the propagation of the plant spread rapidly to Java and other islands of the Indonesian archipelago in the 17th century and to the Americas in the 18th century. Coffee cultivation was started in the Hawaiian Islands in 1825. By the 20th century the greatest concentration of production was centred in the Western Hemisphere—particularly Brazil. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries industrial roasting and grinding machines came into use, vacuum-sealed containers were invented for ground roasts, and decaffeination methods for green coffee beans were developed. After 1950 the production of instant coffee was perfected. The popularity of instant coffee led to increased production of the cheaper Robusta beans in Africa. In 2020 the top coffee-producing countries were Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, Indonesia, and Ethiopia.

One of the first coffee houses was in Boston named the London Coffee House originally in 1689, but the name was later changed to The American Coffee House. During the colonial era, coffee started to gain popularity as a patriotic alternative to tea, especially following the Boston Tea Party in 1773. As tensions between the American colonies and Britain escalated, drinking tea—a symbol of British taxation—was seen as unpatriotic. Coffee, on the other hand, became a symbol of resistance and independence. Founding fathers like Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin were known proponents of coffee, and Jefferson famously referred to it as “the favorite drink of the civilized world.” The Coffee Revolution: 19th Century Expansion The American Revolution further solidified coffee’s place in American society. With tea imports disrupted by the war, colonists turned to coffee, boosting demand and encouraging the growth of the coffee trade. By the end of the 18th century, coffee had firmly established itself in the hearts and cups of Americans, laying the foundation for its rise as the nation’s favorite drink. The 19th century marked a turning point in America’s relationship with coffee, transforming it from a niche indulgence into a nationwide staple. This period saw a dramatic increase in coffee consumption, driven by advancements in transportation, technology, and the growing accessibility of the beverage.

Height = Dominance Across cultures and societies, people who are taller in stature are considered more socially influential, more likely to succeed and more desirable. But why? Well, it all comes down to the fact that taller people are often more dominant, have higher self-esteem, and are more likely to be the victor in a confrontation or competition. Something that served our ancestors well when it was a matter of life or death. Although we don’t find ourselves in situations where we need to fight one another to survive as our ancestors did, we still have the instinctual knowledge in our genes that taller, stronger people are more likely to survive, thrive, and therefore gain higher ranking on the social ladder.

Yoga has the indirect potential to make you stand and appear taller by straightening your spine. But most importantly, it can improve well being, self-esteem and boost confidence. That’s something we could all use more of. Which Yoga Practice is Best for Increasing Height? There are many different types of yoga, but certain poses and practices may be more beneficial to help you improve your height than others. It’s important to make sure you match your yoga practice with the benefits you want to experience. We recommend yoga poses that focus on stretching and lengthening the spine, shoulders and shoulder blades, lower back, and hips to thoroughly work on releasing tension in the ligaments and fascia (deep connective tissue and muscles) surrounding your spine.

Practice good posture Poor posture may make you look shorter than you actually are. And over time, slumping or slouching can also affect your actual height. Your back should curve naturally in three places. If you regularly slump or slouch, these curves may shift to accommodate your new posture. This can cause pain in your neck and back. Being mindful of how you stand, sit, and sleep is key. Talk with a doctor about how you can incorporate ergonomics into your daily routine. Depending on your needs, a standing desk or memory foam pillow may be all that’s needed to correct your posture. You can also practice exercises designed to improve your posture over time.

Although each body is different, it will generally take about this length of time for the body posture to improve enough to give the appearance of more height.

Use fashion to your advantage Real talk: We know it sounds painfully obvious, but heels and platform shoes will give you a boost.

Beyond the Sea depicts Darin's rise to success in both the music and film industry during the 1950s and 1960s as well as his marriage to Sandra Dee, portrayed by Kate Bosworth. As early as 1986, Barry Levinson intended to direct a film based on the life of Darin, and he began pre-production on the project in early 1997. When he eventually vacated the director's position, Spacey, along with Darin's son Dodd, acquired the film rights. Filming for Beyond the Sea took place from November 2003 to January 2004. It was released in December 2004 to mixed reviews from critics and bombed at the box office. Dodd Darin, Sandra Dee and former Darin manager Steve Blauner responded with enthusiastic feedback to Spacey's work on the film. Despite a number of negative reviews, some critics praised Spacey's performance, largely because of his decision to use his own singing voice. He received a Golden Globe nomination. Plot Rather than providing a straightforward biography, the film weaves fantasy sequences with scenes containing somewhat fictionalized accounts of events in Darin's life, and throughout it, the adult singer interacts with his younger self. It chronicles his determination to rise from his working-class roots as Walden Robert Cassotto, a frail boy from The Bronx plagued by multiple bouts of rheumatic fever, who becomes a singer more famous than Frank Sinatra. To achieve that goal, he forms a band and struggles to find gigs at any nightclub that will hire him. As success takes him on the road and away from home, Dee begins to drink heavily, and the couple fights frequently. Eventually, they separate and later reconcile. She gives birth to a son, Dodd. To his actress wife's chagrin, Darin is nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as a shell shocked soldier in Captain Newman, M.D. In the late 1960s, Darin becomes involved in the campaign to elect Robert F.

In 1959 the singer/composer rocketed to stardom with 2 Grammy Awards-Best New Artist and Record of the Year for the #1 smash \"Mack the Knife.\" His other signature smash provides the title for this biopic chronicling his genre-defying music, tempestuous marriage to starlet Sandra Dee, and untimely death at age 37-in 1973-from a heart defect acquired during a childhood illness. Kate Bosworth stars as Dee, and Darin is brought to life by Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey, who also directed the film and sings 18 of the artist's classic hits.

As if this weren't enough, unlike Jamie Foxx in Ray, Spacey performs all the songs himself. The hard-driving \"Hello Young Lovers\" starts off the album with a bang, the actor working with the big band with casual ease. While Darin is now best known for his swinging \"Mack the Knife\" and his adaptation of Charles Trenet's \"La Mer\" (\"Beyond the Sea\"), he also explored folk and scored with the teeny-bopperish \"Splish Splash.\" Spacey acquits himself honorably in all these genres, though he's best when he swings hard--his yelpy \"Splish Splash\" lacks the required levity.

Join us in uncovering one of the darkest chapters in the UK’s history and reflecting on the lessons it holds for us all. The proverb “A bridge too far” is a metaphorical expression that originated from the failed military operation called Operation Market Garden during World War II. The operation was an ambitious plan by the Allied forces to capture several key bridges in the Netherlands to create a direct route into Germany and end the war quickly. However, the operation was ultimately unsuccessful, and the proverb “A bridge too far” has come to represent a situation where a goal or objective is overly ambitious, beyond what is realistically achievable, or too difficult to attain. The key points of the proverb “A bridge too far” include: Ambition: The proverb reflects the idea of setting overly ambitious goals or objectives that may be difficult or impossible to achieve. It suggests that attempting to reach for something that is too far beyond one’s capabilities or resources may result in failure. Realism: The proverb highlights the importance of being realistic and pragmatic in setting goals and expectations. It implies that it is essential to assess the feasibility and attainability of a goal before pursuing it, to avoid reaching for something that is unattainable or unrealistic. Risk-taking: The proverb also suggests that taking on risks that are too high or attempting to achieve something that is beyond reasonable risk levels may result in failure or negative consequences. It emphasizes the need to carefully consider risks and benefits in any endeavor. Consequences of Overreach: The proverb implies that overextending oneself or a situation beyond reasonable limits may lead to negative outcomes or adverse consequences. It warns against pushing too hard or going too far beyond one’s capabilities or resources, as it may result in failure, setback, or disappointment. Lessons from History: The proverb “A bridge too far” originated from the historical context of Operation Market Garden, which serves as a reminder of the risks and challenges of over-ambition and unrealistic goals. It highlights the importance of learning from past mistakes and being mindful of historical lessons when setting goals or pursuing endeavors.", "timestamp": "2025-01-13"}, {"doc_id": "d8", "source_url": "https://www.battle-of-arnhem.com/the-statement-a-bridge-too-far-was-made-before-the-battle-of-arnhem/", "snippet": "The statement \"a bridge too far\" was made before the Battle of Arnhem The phrase is the title of the book that Cornelis Ryan wrote in 1974 about Operation Market Garden, and it is also the title of the film made by Richard ...

The phrase is the title of the book that Cornelis Ryan wrote in 1974 about Operation Market Garden, and it is also the title of the film made by Richard Attenborough in 1977 in response to the book. Browning Many people think that the expression that Arnhem was “a bridge too far” is the conclusion that was drawn after the Battle of Arnhem. However, that is not true. The statement was made a few days before the start of Operation Market Garden by British General Frederick “Boy” Browning. Browning was the commander of the British 1st Airborne Corps. The 1st Airborne Division led by General Urquhart and the Polish Parachute Brigade led by General Sosabowski were part of it. The 1st Airborne Division was established by Browning in 1942. It was Browning who invented the maroon-colored berets for the paratroopers. He also had the famous Pegasus logo designed. When Browning was informed by the planners of Montgomery about the plans for “his” paratroopers near Arnhem, he was told that the British had to occupy the bridges at Arnhem for two days before they were relieved by the ground troops. Browning replied that the paratroopers could last four days. He later admitted to commander Roy Urquhart of the 1st Airborne Division that he had added, “But I think we might be going a bridge too far.” The statement was recorded in 1973 by Cornelis Ryan when writing his book about Market Garden, after which the statement took on a life of its own. So General Browning was skeptical about the plans with his airborne division. At the same time, he dismissed the (retrospective) criticism that was made of the plans. He waved away warnings that German armored units had been seen near Arnhem. He denied that the distance between the landing areas and the bridges over the Rhine would be too far.", "timestamp": "2020-05-23"}, {"doc_id": "d9", "source_url": "https://7esl.com/a-bridge-too-far/", "snippet": "\"A Bridge Too Far\" Meaning, Origin and Examples - 7ESL The phrase comes from the title of the book and film “A Bridge Too Far,” which recounts Operation Market Garden during World War II, an Allied ...

PinA Bridge Too Far – Created by 7ESL “A Bridge Too Far” Meaning The phrase “a bridge too far” refers to an attempt that is considered overly ambitious, risky, or ultimately unattainable. It signifies a situation where someone has overreached in their goals or aspirations, often leading to failure or a significant setback. Examples: “His plan to complete the project in a week was a bridge too far; we need more time to do it properly.” “Attempting to expand the business internationally without proper research was a bridge too far.” Origin of This Idiomatic Expression The phrase comes from the title of the book and film “A Bridge Too Far,” which recounts Operation Market Garden during World War II, an Allied military operation aimed at capturing key bridges in the Netherlands to facilitate a swift advance into Germany. The operation ultimately failed, as the Allies attempted to capture a bridge at Arnhem, which proved to be “too far” beyond their reach. Usage of “A Bridge Too Far” In a business context: “The proposal to expand into three new markets at once was a bridge too far for the management team.” Talking about personal goals: “While I appreciate his enthusiasm, trying to run a marathon without proper training was definitely a bridge too far.” In a discussion about project planning: “The idea of completing the project in just one month is a bridge too far, given the resources we have.”", "timestamp": "2024-10-15"}, {"doc_id": "d10", "source_url": "https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2023/06/13/for-trump-supporters-a-bridge-too-far-must-be-nearby/", "snippet": "For Trump supporters, 'a bridge too far' must be nearby This phrase comes from the title of the 1974 book of the same name, by Cornelius Ryan.

For Trump supporters, ‘a bridge too far’ must be nearby June 13, 2023 7:00 am I often wonder where idioms like “a bridge too far” originate. This phrase comes from the title of the 1974 book of the same name, by Cornelius Ryan. The book tells the story of Operation Market Garden, the Allies’ plan of attack to conquer several bridges in the Netherlands in September of 1944. The goal was to establish a route over the Rhine River for an invasion into Germany. The Allies never captured that last bridge at Arnhem, and the mission ultimately failed. For Americans who possess apparently unrelenting fealty to former President Donald Trump, the bridges in front of them are also numerous. Trump’s influence, his top position in Republican party politics, relies on a constituency that will seemingly follow him anywhere. Trump famously said in January of 2016, “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose any voters, OK?” In June of 2023, the zombies who support him would apparently applaud such a thing. What would the cadre of elected officials, who desperately want this crowd of voters to see them synonymously with the indicted former president, do? They might claim the NYPD is simply an arm of the evil Democratic Party, or even the sinister Biden campaign, and that arresting their dear leader for murder is merely a political stunt. Need to get in touch? Have a news tip? It sounds ridiculous, but it isn’t. The federal indictment that was released last week, and the arraignment scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, challenges the seriousness of murder. What!? How could an editorial writer write something so offensive? Trump just “mishandled” some paper! All politicians do it! First of all, no they don’t. No American, a politician or otherwise, has ever done what Donald Trump is accused of here. He took sensitive, classified, dangerous documents from the White House that he was not authorized to take. That actually does happen with alarming regularity.", "timestamp": "2023-06-13"}]}

Origins Aram Shah is an obscure figure, and his relationship to his predecessor Qutb al-Din Aibak is not certain. In some manuscripts of Minhaj-i-Siraj's Tabaqat-i Nasiri, the words \"bin Aibak\" (\"son of Qutub-i-deen-Aibak\") appear after his name in a chapter heading, and later writers believed him to be a son of Aibak. However, the words \"bin Aibak\" in the headline may have been an erroneous addition made by a scribe.[1] Minhaj-i-Siraj refers to only three daughters of Aibak elsewhere in the text, and Ata-Malik Juvayni's Tarikh-i Jahangushay explicitly states that Aibak did not have any son.[2] What is known is that he succeeded Aibak in city of Lahore.[3] Reign In 1210, Qutb al-Din Aibak died unexpectedly in Lahore during a sport game, without having named a successor. To prevent instability in the kingdom, the Turkic nobles (maliks and amirs) in Lahore appointed Aram Shah as his successor at Lahore.[3][2] However, the Turkic nobles in different parts of the Sultanate opposed his ascension, and some of them - such as the Khalji nobles of Bengal - rebelled against him. According to the 16th century historian Firishta, the kingdom also suffered an invasion from the neighbouring ruler Nasir ad-Din Qabacha of Multan.[1] A group of nobles, led by the military justiciar (Amir-i Dad) Ali-yi Ismail, invited Iltutmish to occupy the throne.[4] Iltutmish, a former slave of Aibak and the governor of Badaun, had a distinguished record of service and was called a son by Aibak, because of which the nobles considered him as a good candidate for the throne.[5] Iltutmish marched to Delhi, where he seized the power, and later defeated Aram Shah's forces at Bagh-i Jud.", "timestamp": "2025-03-13"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "source_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutb_ud-Din_Aibak", "snippet": "Qutb ud-Din Aibak - Wikipedia Aibak was succeeded by Aram Shah, and then by his former slave and son-in-law Iltutmish, who transformed the loosely-held Ghurid territories of India into the ... 3] Qaimaz Rumi assigned the iqta' of Devkot to Husamuddin Iwaz Khalji, another subordinate of Bakhtiyar. Muhammad Shiran and other Khalji amirs disagreed with this decision and marched to Devkot. However, Rumi defeated them decisively, and Shiran was later killed in a conflict. Later, Aibak assigned Lakhnauti to Ali Mardan (see below).[43] Tajul-Ma'asir, a contemporary chronicle by Hasan Nizami, suggests that Muhammad Ghori appointed Aibak as his representative in India after his victory at Tarain. Hasan Nizami also states that the iyalat (governorship) of Kuhram and Samana was entrusted to Aibak.[44] Fakhr-i Mudabbir, another contemporary chronicler, states that Muhammad Ghori formally appointed Aibak as the viceroy of his Indian territories only in 1206 when he was returning to Ghazni after suppressing the Khokhar rebellion. According to this chronicler, Aibak was promoted to the rank of malik and appointed heir apparent (wali al-ahd) of the Sultan's Indian territories.[45] Historian K. A. Nizami theorizes that Sultan Muhammad Ghori never appointed Aibak as his successor in India: the slave-general acquired this position after the Sultan's death through the use of diplomacy and military power. The Sultan's unexpected death left three of his main slave-generals – Aibak, Taj al-Din Yildiz, and Nasir ad-Din Qabacha – in positions of power.[37] During his last years, the Sultan was disappointed in his family and his chiefs and trusted only his slaves, whom he thought of as his sons and successors.[46] At the time of the Sultan's death, Aibak had his headquarters at Delhi. The citizens of Lahore requested him to assume sovereign power after the Sultan's death, and he moved his government to Lahore.", "timestamp": "2025-03-31"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "source_url": "https://www.embibe.com/questions/Who-ascended-the-throne-of-Delhi-after-Qutb-ud-din-Aibak%3F/EM5598903", "snippet": "Who ascended the throne of Delhi after Qutbuddin Aibak - EMBIBE After the sudden death of Qutbuddin Aibak while playing polo Aram Shah has become the Sultan To prevent the instability in the kingdom nobles in the kingdom ...", "timestamp": "2025-03-12"}, {"doc_id": "d5", "source_url": "https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/mamluk-dynasty/", "snippet": "Slave Dynasty [1206-1290] - Iltutmish, Razia Sultan, Qutb-ud-din ...

The nobles were divided into two groups – the Turkish nobles and the Taziqs. The former called themselves as Sultani and formed a group of Forty called Turkan-iChihalgani.

The latter’s son Rukn-ud-din Firuz was imprisoned and killed and in his place Raziya, his sister was enthroned.

Lets start with the good things. 'Seed of Chucky' looks great. It is filmed with a lot of atmosphere, has a suitably eerie look and the special effects are nothing short of terrific. The music score is one of the best of the series, its hauntingly ominous sounds not easy to forget in the long run. Tiffany steals the show here pretty much, being both amusing and creepy, and Jennifer Tilly does have a ball playing her, wisely not taking it too seriously. Brad Dourif is still deliciously malevolent as Chucky, though he should have had more to do. While not near as fresh or witty as the humour in 'Bride of Chucky', there are some darkly funny parts and lines. The parodies and in-jokes need familiarity in order to get them, being familiar with a vast majority of them this was not a problem for me, but some do work. The memorable being a quite hilarious cameo from John Waters. Another scene stealer was Glen/Glenda, hilariously played by Billy Boyd. 'Seed of Chucky' however has a number of serious problems. The story is both daft and lacking oomph, also suffering from trying to cram in too much and struggling to balance it all and properly exploring it. Meaning it all feels muddled and over-stuffed with the Glen/Glenda being particularly over-complicated. With the funny moments, there are moments but it's not consistent. Other parts feel very limp and stale. Found that the supporting cast on the most part were very bland, with one of the biggest faults of the film being the utterly wretched performance from Redman, out of place and annoying. 'Seed of Chucky' is severely lacking in the horror elements, where there is pretty much no atmosphere or mood. It is more reliant on gore rather than suspense or creepiness, and it is a big problem as it is overused to the point of abuse and too much of it is rather gratuitously tasteless.", "timestamp": "2018-12-28"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "source_url": "https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/movies/Seed-of-Chucky/", "snippet": "Seed of Chucky (2004 Movie) - Behind The Voice Actors The Seed of Chucky Cast ...

Born at the expense of their estranged mother Tiffany dying immediately after they were born, Glen lives a life of embarrassment and abuse as a ventriloquist's dummy. A man dressed as Santa Claus walks through a cemetery while on the phone, with his girlfriend. He describes the many things he wants to do to her later, when she informs him they are breaking up. He assumes she meant the connection, but then realizes she meant in their relationship and hangs up. Just then a knife pierces out from the bag of toys he's carrying. He hears some toys activate and turns around to find the hole in the bag and the toys on the floor. As he rages in frustration, he notices Chucky against a tombstone and goes to look at it. As he does Tiffany and Chucky begin to attack him. Chucky starts screaming that lying about Santa can fuck with kids' minds, and Tiffany laughs. Chucky begins to repeat his words and a voice yells that Chucky's broken, revealing the movie set for \"Chucky Goes Psycho\", with the dolls attached to a robotic control. The Santa Claus actor storms off the set while they attempt to repair Chucky.
